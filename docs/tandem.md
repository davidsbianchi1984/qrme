# Tandem architecture

Three separate products in three separate repositories — each stands alone
and can also **interoperate over HTTP**. No project imports another's code.

- [`qrme`](https://github.com/davidsbianchi1984/qrme) — AI synthetic-profile
  platform (relationship-aware profiles, memory, moderation)
- [`jim-mini`](https://github.com/davidsbianchi1984/jim-mini) — Guardian
  personal-guidance system (monitor → predict → guide → escalate, life layer)
- [`pdi`](https://github.com/davidsbianchi1984/pdi) — Private Data
  Infrastructure (encrypted vault, tenant isolation, tamper-evident audit)

## qrme ✕ jim-mini

JIM-mini is a standalone personal-guidance system: it monitors a user's
biometric and contextual signals, detects known conditions, delivers guidance,
and escalates on critical events. It runs entirely on its own using its own
guidance engine.

When a **tandem specialist** is registered for a condition and JIM is
configured with a QRME endpoint (`JIM_QRME_URL`), JIM delegates guidance for
that condition to a QRME specialist synthetic profile — reached only through
`jim/qrme_client.py` over QRME's public HTTP API. The QRME reply passes QRME's
own persona conditioning, moderation, and per-user memory before JIM surfaces
it. Without the endpoint, JIM uses its own standalone guidance — the two
remain independent.

## qrme / jim-mini ✕ pdi

PDI is a separate secure-hosting product: a private, encrypted data vault with
a tamper-evident audit log and a tenant registry, modeling the "Private Data
Infrastructure" proposal (on-premises or colocation deployment, optional
AI-system integration).

Each AI system can *optionally* run on top of PDI as a tenant, each with its
own client and token — both integrations are live:

- **jim-mini** (`jim/pdi_client.py`, `JIM_PDI_URL` + `JIM_PDI_TOKEN`): medical
  payloads — biometric samples, detection details, forecast trends, check-in
  notes — and consented context payloads are sealed under `jim/{user}/…`
  keys; JIM's own database keeps only key references, prediction reads prior
  samples back from the vault, and `DELETE /data/{user_id}` purges the vault.
- **qrme** (`qrme/pdi_client.py`, `QRME_PDI_URL` + `QRME_PDI_TOKEN`): profile
  source material — life stories, writings, conversations, voice transcripts —
  is sealed under `qrme/{profile}/sources/…` keys, resolved on read for
  persona prompts and exports, and purged when the profile is deleted.

The AI systems do not depend on PDI to function; PDI is the "run on top of"
infrastructure layer they integrate with when deployed in a private
environment. Every vault access lands in PDI's hash-chained audit log, and
`GET /audit/verify` detects any retroactive edit.

## Why over HTTP, not imports

Each product is independently deployable, versioned, and separately repo'd.
Interoperation only through public HTTP APIs keeps the boundaries honest: any
project can be run, tested, and shipped without the others present.

## Cross-cutting design (identity, deletion, billing, compliance)

The three products interoperate but stay independently deployable. This
section specifies the cross-cutting concerns. **[implemented]** = in code;
**[planned]** = intended design.

### Unified identity & account linking **[planned]**

Today each system has its own principals: QRME `interactor`/`owner`, JIM
`user`, PDI `tenant`. There is deliberately **no shared user table** — that
keeps the boundaries honest and each product runnable alone.

The planned account-linking layer is opt-in and reference-based, not a shared
database:

- A thin **identity broker** (OIDC) issues a stable `subject` id. Each app
  stores that `subject` against its own principal (a nullable
  `linked_subject` column) — so a person is *recognized* across apps without
  any app owning the others' data.
- Linking is explicit: the user authorizes app B to associate its principal
  with the same `subject` as app A. Unlinking is always available.
- The tandem clients already pass no personal identity across the HTTP
  boundary (JIM→QRME uses an opaque interactor id it created; QRME→PDI uses a
  tenant token) — the broker sits *above* this and never widens what crosses
  the wire.

### Data-deletion propagation **[implemented locally + planned cross-app]**

Within each app, deletion is complete today: QRME `DELETE /profiles/{id}` and
JIM `DELETE /data/{user_id}` erase every local table **and** purge that
principal's PDI vault records via tracked keys. **[implemented]**

Cross-app propagation is **user-controlled** **[planned]**: when a user
deletes in one app they choose the scope —

- **This app only** (default): the app erases its own data and its own PDI
  keys; other apps are untouched.
- **Everywhere**: if accounts are linked, the app emits a signed
  `deletion_request{subject}` to the broker, which fans out to the linked
  apps; each performs its own local erasure and PDI purge and acknowledges.
  Acknowledgements are collected so the user sees a complete-deletion receipt.

PDI never initiates deletion — it is the storage layer; the owning app always
drives the purge of its own keys, so there is no orphaned ciphertext.

### Billing / subscription **[planned]**

A single subscription spans the three products, metered per product:

- QRME: active profiles, interactions, marketplace transactions.
- JIM-mini: monitored users, guidance sessions, provider handoffs.
- PDI: tenants, ciphertext bytes, ops/day (derivable from the audit chain —
  see PDI `docs/operations.md`).

The billing system lives outside the three repos; each exposes a
usage/metering read (`GET /usage`, admin) that a downstream biller
aggregates against the linked `subject`. Entitlements (which tiers unlock
adult mode, cloud model, knowledge packs) are checked at the app boundary.

### Exact tandem data flows & error handling **[implemented]**

**JIM → QRME specialist handoff** (guidance delegation):
1. A condition is detected for a JIM user with a `tandem` specialist
   registered (`qrme_profile_id`).
2. JIM lazily creates a QRME interactor for the user (once, tracked in
   `tandem_links`) via `POST /interactors`.
3. JIM calls `POST /profiles/{qrme_profile_id}/chat` with a `[Guardian
   monitoring]` framed message describing the condition.
4. QRME conditions the reply on the specialist persona, runs it through
   **QRME's own moderation**, stores it in per-user memory, and returns
   `{content, status, flag_reason}`.
5. JIM surfaces `content` when `status=approved`; a `pending` (held) reply is
   reported to the user as awaiting approval, not shown.
- **Fallback**: if a tandem specialist is registered but no QRME endpoint is
  configured, JIM falls back to its own standalone guidance and says so — the
  user is never left without help.

**App → PDI vault** (sealed storage):
1. The app seals a payload under a namespaced key (`jim/{user}/…`,
   `qrme/{profile}/…`) via `PUT /records`; only the key reference stays local.
2. Reads resolve the key back through `GET /records/{key}`; a missing key
   returns None and the app degrades gracefully.
- **Fallback / offline**: PDI is optional — with no PDI configured, both apps
  store data locally exactly as before. A PDI outage mid-operation surfaces as
  a storage error the app handles; detection/insight rules run on the payload
  in memory *before* sealing, so behavior is identical whether or not the seal
  succeeds.

### Consent management **[implemented per-app + planned unified]**

Consent lives with the app that collects it today: QRME captures profile
verification, third-party rights basis, and `cloud_contribution`; JIM captures
terms/guardian consent, emergency-contact consent, per-source consent,
`provider_consent`, and `cloud_contribution`. **[implemented]**

A **unified consent center** **[planned]** presents all of a linked
`subject`'s consents (biometric sources, profile sources, contact, provider
handoff, cloud contribution, adult mode) in one place, each toggleable, with
every change written to PDI's audit chain for a regulator-exportable trail.

### Security & compliance **[implemented foundations + planned]**

- **Encryption at rest**: AES-256-GCM in PDI, AAD-bound per tenant+key.
  **[implemented]**
- **Audit**: PDI's tamper-evident hash chain records every data access;
  `GET /audit/verify` proves integrity. **[implemented]**
- **Access control**: PDI admin endpoints require `PDI_ADMIN_TOKEN`; data
  plane is tenant-token scoped with read/write roles. **[implemented]**
- **GDPR**: right-to-erasure = the deletion propagation above; data-portability
  = each app's `export`. **[planned: the cross-app deletion receipt]**
- **HIPAA** (JIM medical data): PHI is sealed in PDI, access is audited, and
  provider handoff is consent-gated and revocable — the technical safeguards
  are in place; a production deployment adds a BAA with the KMS/hosting
  provider. **[planned: formal BAA + access-log export for auditors]**
- **Regulator audit export** **[planned]**: `GET /audit/export` (admin,
  per-tenant) produces a signed, verifiable slice of the audit chain.

### Testing strategy for the tandem stack **[implemented]**

- Each repo's suite runs standalone with an offline stub provider and no
  external services (QRME 59, JIM 49, PDI 20 tests).
- Cross-service boundaries are exercised with doubles at the HTTP-client seam
  (JIM's `FakeQRME`, QRME/JIM's `FakePDIHttp`, the `FakeCloudHttp` gateway) —
  so tandem logic is covered without standing up the other services.
- A verified end-to-end run wires the **real** apps in-process (JIM ✕ real
  QRME, JIM/QRME ✕ real PDI) to confirm the seams: sealed medical payloads
  resolve, the audit chain stays intact, and erasure empties the vault.
- **[planned]**: a `docker compose` harness that boots all three and runs a
  full-stack end-to-end flow (enroll → monitor → detect → QRME specialist →
  vault → handoff → erase) as CI.
