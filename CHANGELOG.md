# Changelog

All notable changes to QRME are documented here. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and the project
adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **First-run onboarding screens** — provider login (Continue with Apple /
  Google / email), identity & age verification, access permissions, Avatar
  Studio (2D portrait + 3D avatar), immersive AR/VR chat, live video, and an
  "all set" summary — the full first-run → profile-building funnel, rendered in
  both iOS and Android chrome.

### Fixed

- Two text-overflow issues on the onboarding screens (the Verify Identity badge
  row and the Immersive Chat subtitle).

## [0.1.0] — 2026-07-21

First public release. QRME is the AI synthetic-profile platform of the
three-product suite (with [jim-mini](https://github.com/davidsbianchi1984/jim-mini)
and [pdi](https://github.com/davidsbianchi1984/pdi)).

### Added

- **Profiles & relationships** — create self / third-party (consent-gated) /
  fictional profiles with age & identity verification; relationship-aware
  behavior (`PUT /profiles/{id}/relationships/{interactor}`) and
  engagement-based style adaptation that never moves identity or boundaries.
- **Memory & moderation** — per-(profile, interactor) memory; every reply
  passes moderation, with an optional owner approval queue.
- **Lifecycle** — aging, succession (`/succeed`), memorial state
  (`/memorial`), graceful sunset (`/sunset`), and a full objection / takedown /
  appeal flow (`/objections` + `resolve` / `withdraw` / `attest`).
- **Summoning** — `@handle`, `#tag`, and QR beacons (`/summon`, `/beacons`,
  `/profiles/{id}/handle`).
- **Marketplace & licensing** — listings, ownership transfer, training-data
  licensing, and derivable specialist agents.
- **Assistant & perception** — compose / proofread / triage helpers,
  embodiments, workflows, and proactive outreach with user-set quiet hours.
- **Cloud model** — optional greater-model gateway with automatic local
  fallback and opt-in, individually revocable contributions.
- **PDI tandem** — seal source material and fine-tune artifacts in the
  encrypted vault; erasure purges the vaulted keys.
- **Data ownership** — full export and complete erasure at any time; bearer
  capability tokens stored only as SHA-256 hashes.
- **Suite gateway** (`suite/gateway.py`) — one origin fronting all three
  products, unified sign-on, and a stateless cross-cutting control plane:
  suite-wide erase (with receipt), export, centralized vault-sealed consent,
  and usage metering.
- **Apps** — a runnable React + Vite + Electron desktop console and mobile
  screen designs; a suite launcher; CI that smoke-builds the front-ends and a
  per-OS installer release workflow.
