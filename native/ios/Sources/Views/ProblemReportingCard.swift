/// The notice that has to be answered before anything leaves the device, and
/// the switch that turns it off afterwards.
///
/// The sending half landed last round and answers `.awaitingNotice` on every
/// launch, because there was no surface to answer it on. That is the safe
/// direction to be wrong in, and it is still wrong: a mechanism nobody can
/// reach is a mechanism nobody chose.
///
/// Two rules this card exists to keep:
///
/// * **Show the report, do not describe it.** A card that says "we collect
///   anonymous diagnostics" is asking somebody to take our word for it.
///   `Problems.report` is the same function the sender posts, so what is on
///   screen is the payload, byte for byte. A preview that could drift from
///   the message would be worse than no preview, because it would look like
///   a promise.
/// * **No pre-ticked answer.** Neither button is styled as the expected one
///   and neither is focused by default. A dialog with a bright Yes and a grey
///   No has made the choice already.
