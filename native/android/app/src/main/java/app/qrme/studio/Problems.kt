/**
 * What went wrong, recorded without recording anything private.

 * The console's `app/src/errors.ts` in this repository, in Kotlin. Same rules,
 * same refusals — written from that file rather than invented again, so the
 * two cannot drift into disagreeing about what a failure may say about itself.
 *
 * Every failed request passes through one place in [ApiClient], so one call
 * there catches the lot. The hard part is not the catching. The backends put
 * user input straight into their error messages — *no device called 'Pixel
 * Buds' on this account*, *unknown site 'knee'* — which are good messages for
 * the person reading them and device names and body sites to anybody else. The
 * message is shown and never written down.
 *
 * The path goes the same way: `/profiles/prf_0de08e794ed0/chat` identifies a
 * person, `POST /profiles/{id}/chat` identifies a bug, and only the second is
 * kept. Redaction happens on the way *in*, so the stored buffer never holds
 * something that would later have to be scrubbed.
