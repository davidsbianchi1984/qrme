"""The drawer nobody empties.

## The finding

Task #110 gave all three native shells content-free error capture, and it did
that part well: `record` templates the route, drops the message, keeps the day
and not the time, and redacts on the way *in* so the buffer never holds
something that would later have to be scrubbed.

Then nothing sent it anywhere.

Nine shells across three products recorded failures into a fifty-row buffer
that filled up and rolled over. Only the desktop console — `app/src/errors.ts`
— ever had the second half. The tell was sitting in the model the whole time:
every shell declares a `sent` field documented as *"how much of `count` has
already been reported"*, and nothing in any of them ever read it, because
nothing ever reported. The comment described behaviour that was not in the
file.

    asked     is the failure recorded without recording anything private
    mattered  does the failure reach anybody

Per shell, never as a union: the console having both halves is exactly what
made this invisible for four releases. "Error reporting works" was true of one
client out of four, per product.

## What this checks

For each named shell — not for "the native directory" — that the sending half
exists and is wired: a report builder, a watermark that advances by amount, a
collector address that is empty by default, a notice gate, and a call at
launch. The address and the notice are checked as hard as the sender is,
because a sender with a baked-in address and no notice is a worse defect than
no sender at all.
