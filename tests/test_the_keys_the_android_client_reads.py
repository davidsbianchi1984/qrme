"""Kotlin declares nothing, and reads everything by name.

The Windows client says what it expects in records, and Swift in structs, so
0.56.4 through 0.56.8 could ask both of them the same question: is every
declared field a key the route sends, in a shape the declared type can decode.
Nineteen defects in C#, nine in Swift, every Swift one already fixed in C# and
never carried across.

The 0.56.8 changelog left Kotlin out with a hedge:

> *it parses `JSONObject` by hand rather than declaring shapes, so there is
> nothing to compare — which is either a reason it cannot have this defect, or
> the reason nobody would find it.*

It was the second one. This client declares nothing, but every line of it is
two claims at once:

    val o = JSONObject(request("/profiles/$id/wearables", token = token))
    val worn = o.optJSONObject("kinds_worn")

`"kinds_worn"` says the route sends that key. `optJSONObject` says it is an
object. Both can be wrong, and the way they go wrong here is worse than
elsewhere, because `org.json` does not throw:

* `optString` on a key the route never sends returns `""`;
* `optInt` on a string returns `0`;
* `optJSONArray` on an object returns `null`, and the `?:` beside it quietly
  substitutes an empty one.

A C# client with the wrong type throws and somebody sees a crash. This one
draws a screen with nothing on it, and that is the harder defect to notice —
so *no declarations* was never a reason it could not have this defect. It was
a reason it would never be found.

    asked     does the client declare the right shape
    mattered  does the client ask for the right thing

## What is checked

Every GET whose response this client reads, in the four shapes these three
clients read one in:

* bound and read by name — `val o = ...request(...)`, then `o.optString("k")`;
* handed to a parse helper — `crashWatchOf(request(...))`, whose reads off its
  `JSONObject` parameter are this route's claims one indirection away;
* read inline — `request(...).getString("provider")`;
* chained — `...request(...).getJSONArray("providers")`, where the chained key
  is the claim and what hangs off it is not.

The `JSONObject(` constructor around the call is **optional**, and that single
character of laxity is most of this guard's reach. QRME's `request` returns a
`String` and every read wraps it; JIM-mini's returns a `JSONObject` and none
of them do. Requiring the wrapper read one client whole and the other at
twelve routes out of forty-two — which looked exactly like a client with
twelve routes.

Keys read off a *nested* object are not claims about the response:
`worn.optString(k)` is about `kinds_worn`'s contents, and crediting it to the
top level accused three routes of fields they never read there.

Scalar accessors are held to the coercion `org.json` actually performs:
`optString` on a number or a boolean is a deliberate stringification and is
allowed. `optString` on an *object* or an *array* is not, and neither is
`optInt` on a string — those are the reads that return a plausible wrong
answer instead of failing.
