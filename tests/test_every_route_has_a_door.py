"""Every route the backend serves is reachable from a client — or is on the list.

The inverse of the route guard. That one asks whether every call reaches a
route; this asks whether every route is reachable from a door a user can open.

It is the quieter of the two failures. A client asking for a route that does not
exist produces a 404 somebody eventually reports. A route no client asks for
produces nothing at all: the code is present, its tests pass, the changelog says
it shipped — and the capability is simply unreachable.

QRME has a long backlog of these, so the current state is recorded in
`doorless_routes.txt` rather than asserted to be empty. The list is a backlog,
not an approval. Two things follow from that, and both are the point:

* **It cannot grow.** A new route with no door fails this test, so the gap stops
  widening on the day it is noticed rather than the day someone goes looking.
* **It must shrink deliberately.** Building a door makes the test fail too,
  telling you to strike the line. A backlog that quietly re-fills is how the
  first five came to be there.

Browser-facing paths — a QR image used as an `<img src>`, a landing page reached
by scanning — are excluded in `clientpaths.NOT_A_CLIENT_CALL`, not listed here.
