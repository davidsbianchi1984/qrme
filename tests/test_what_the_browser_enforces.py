"""The rules the server declares and the browser enforces.

0.59.1 found a CORS defect in a sibling product by comparing three
repositories, not by testing behaviour — because **no test in this estate
could have found it.** Every one of them calls the app through a
`TestClient`, which never sends an `Origin`, never runs a preflight, and
never drops a response for want of a header. The whole class is invisible.

    asked     does the server answer
    mattered  does the answer reach the reader

## What that blindness was hiding here

An unhandled exception is rendered by Starlette's `ServerErrorMiddleware`,
which sits **outside** every middleware this app adds — including CORS. So a
500 went back to a browser with no `access-control-allow-origin`, and the
browser discarded the entire response. Measured over HTTP at 0.59.2, in all
three products:

    GET /health   200   access-control-allow-origin: *
    a 500         500   access-control-allow-origin: None

The consequence is worse than a missing header. This estate's consoles
distinguish *the backend is unreachable* from *the backend refused* — the
version-mismatch guard and the content-free problem reporter both depend on
it — and a 500 the browser throws away is indistinguishable from the first.
Every crash in this product reached its user as "Failed to fetch".

Registering `@app.exception_handler(Exception)` does not fix it: Starlette
hands that handler to `ServerErrorMiddleware`, still outside the CORS layer.
It has to be a middleware, inside CORS, which is why the CORS block is now the
last one the factory adds — and why the ordering has its own check below. The
three products used to disagree about it: two added CORS before their
request-scoped middleware and one after.

## Why this file starts a real server

Everything above is invisible from inside the process. So this file boots the
app under uvicorn on an ephemeral port and talks to it with a plain HTTP
client, sending the header a browser would send. It is slower than the rest of
the suite and it is the only way to ask the question at all.

The last test in this file is the point of the whole exercise: it makes the
same request through a `TestClient` and shows it passing.

    plain-text "Internal Server Error" instead of this product's JSON.
