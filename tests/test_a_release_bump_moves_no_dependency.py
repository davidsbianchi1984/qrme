"""A release bump moves the version and nothing else.

Cutting a release means changing one number in three places:
`pyproject.toml`, `app/package.json`, and `app/package-lock.json`. The
lockfile is the one that bites. It carries the project's own version
twice — at the top, and inside `packages[""]` — and it also carries the
resolved version of every dependency in the tree. A blind substitution of
the old number for the new one cannot tell those apart.

## What this found

3.2.0 shipped with `ejs` rewritten from `^3.1.10` to `^3.2.0`, because the
project itself had been at 3.1.10. There is no `ejs@3.2.0`. Every image
build died at `npm ci` with a 404 from the registry, on all three products
at once, and the tag was already published by the time anything ran.

    asked     is the app at the new version
    mattered  is every dependency still at a version that exists

## The shape of this guard

The lockfile is hashed with the project's own two version fields masked
out. A release bump touches only those two, so the fingerprint does not
move when the app's version does — and anything else that changes moves
it. The recorded fingerprint lives in `lockfile_dependencies.txt`, so
changing a dependency on purpose is one deliberate line in a file that
says what moved, and changing one by accident during a version cut is a
red suite before the tag exists.
