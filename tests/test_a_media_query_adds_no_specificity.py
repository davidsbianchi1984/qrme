"""A media query that a later rule overrules is a rule nobody ever runs.

## The defect, three times

Three separate rounds shipped the same mistake, in three different
products, and no test in this estate said a word about any of them:

    .help-fab      (JIM-mini)  lifted clear of the tab bar in an @media
                               block declared two hundred lines above the
                               base rule it was overriding
    .vault-light   (PDI)       the same, under a comment explaining the fix
    .talk-panel    (QRME)      `max-height: none` on a short screen,
                               defeated by a second base `max-height: 60vh`
                               nine hundred lines further down

In each one somebody wrote the override, read it back, and had every
reason to believe it worked. The browser disagreed for a reason that is
one sentence long and easy to forget: **a media query adds no
specificity.** `@media (max-height: 600px) { .talk-panel { ... } }` and
`.talk-panel { ... }` are both `(0, 1, 0)`, so between them the later
source order wins — even though one is a narrow, conditional, obviously
more specific-sounding thing than the other.

    asked     is there a rule that overrides it
    mattered  is that the rule the browser uses

## What this checks, and what it deliberately does not

For every declaration inside an at-rule block, this looks for a
declaration of the *same property* on a *textually identical selector* in
an unconditioned rule *later in the file*. Identical selector text means
identical specificity by construction, so a hit is never a specificity
judgement call — it is always the plain source-order rule, and always a
dead declaration.

It does not compare different selectors. `.talk-panel` inside a media
block and `.chat-rail-dock .talk-panel` after it is a real and correct
pattern — the second is more specific and is *supposed* to win — and a
checker that guessed at specificity across differing selectors would
report those and be ignored within a week.

A declaration marked `!important` inside the at-rule is skipped: it beats
a later plain declaration, so it is not dead.
