"""The refusal was a sentence, in the reader's language, naming a field they
could not see.

## The finding

An earlier round took the 422 from `[{"type":"missing",...}]` to one sentence a
person can read, in their own language. It stopped one step short, and said so
in its own docstring:

    Mapping those names to the labels a form actually shows — *"Nome de
    exibição"* rather than `display_name` — is a per-client table this does not
    have, and is recorded as the remaining gap rather than guessed at.

So a person mistyping the sign-up form was told:

    display_name — Field required

while the form beside it said **Profile name**, and had said it in ten
languages since the console was localized.

    asked     is the refusal a sentence in the reader's language
    mattered  does it name the field the reader can see

## Where the table lives, and why

Server-side, beside the sentence, for the reason the sentence is composed there
at all: nine clients rendering it is nine chances to render it differently, and
six of those are in languages with no test runner in this repository.

Wording is ported from the console's own labels where one exists —
`onb.profile.name`, `onb.persona`, `onb.email`, `onb.password` — so the
sentence and the form agree by construction rather than by somebody keeping
them in step.

There is no mechanical mapping for the rest. The console's rows are keyed by
screen, not by field, and a name-match across them returns `title` → *"A
profile depicts me"*, which is a heading on the objection pane. Guessing is
what the docstring above declined to do, and this table does not.

## The fallback is the identifier, on purpose

A field with no row keeps its API name. That is not a placeholder for a better
answer: an identifier a reader can match to the form in front of them beats a
word invented for them, and it is the same reasoning
`refusals_untranslated.txt` uses to keep `QRME_ADMIN_TOKEN` in English.
