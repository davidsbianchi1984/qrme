"""Every route is reachable **from the console** — or is on the list.

`test_every_route_has_a_door.py` reached zero and stayed there. It asks
whether every route is reachable from *a* client, and `clientpaths.doorless`
answers it over the union of four surfaces: the console and the iOS, Android
and Windows shells.

That union is the flaw. A route only the phone calls counts as doored, so the
number went to zero while a desktop owner could not reach sixty-four of them.
Nine were the whole seller's side of the product — post a licence offer, see
who holds one, revoke it, read what any of it earned, ask to be paid. All
present on the phone's Earn tab. All absent from the console, and the guard
had nothing to say about it because it was answering *some client can reach
this*, which was true, rather than *this client can reach this*, which was
not.

That is the same shape as every other defect this audit has produced: a
checker answering a question slightly to the left of the one that matters,
and passing.

So this file asks the console's question on its own. The union guard stays —
a route no client anywhere calls is still worse — and this one sits beside it
with a snapshot of its own, worked down the same way the first one was: **64
at the start, and it must not grow.**

The obvious objection is that a phone-only capability is a legitimate design
choice, and it is: a camera roll has no business on a desktop. That is what
the snapshot is for. Deferring a route means adding a line to it, which takes
a deliberate edit and shows up in a diff — the difference between a decision
and an oversight being whether anybody made it.
