"""A workflow that fires only on `main` cannot inform the merge into `main`.

0.60.2 found `native.yml` red for a hundred and twenty-three consecutive runs.
Nothing was wrong with what it ran — three real toolchains, three real
compilers, and every error it named turned out to be a real defect. What was
wrong was *when*. Its trigger was:

    on:
      pull_request:
      push:
        branches: [main]

Releases here are fast-forward merges, so no pull request is ever opened; and
a push to `main` is what happens *after* somebody has decided to ship. Both
halves fired only where the answer could no longer change anything.

Then `ci.yml` turned out to carry the identical trigger, and to have been red
for twenty-nine consecutive runs, on four guards that shell out to node — the
JSX-text extractor could not import `typescript`, because the job that runs
pytest never installed the app's `node_modules`. Same shape, one workflow
along: a suite green on a developer's machine and red where it actually runs,
reported into a log nothing read.

    asked     does the workflow pass
    mattered  can the workflow's answer still change the decision

Two products, two workflows, a hundred and fifty-two red runs between them,
and no human or machine step in the loop ever opened one. That is not a
failure of attention that trying harder fixes. It is a wiring fault, and the
wiring is in a file this suite can read.

## What this checks, and what it deliberately does not

A workflow gates a change when it is expected to fail a branch *before* that
branch is merged. For those, a `push:` trigger with no branch filter is the
only shape that fires where the answer matters.

Not every workflow gates. Three here do not, and each says so in its own
header:

  - `e2e.yml` boots three containers and is deliberately post-merge
  - `desktop-release.yml` fires on a release tag, which only exists after
  - `sync-release-notes.yml` publishes notes for a tag, likewise

Those are named in `POST_MERGE` below. Naming one is a decision with a
reason, which is the point: the failure this guard exists for was nobody
having made the decision at all.

## Why the assertion is on the trigger and not on the result

A guard that read the *runs* would need the network, a token, and a live
GitHub. This reads the checked-in trigger, which is the thing that was wrong
and the thing a change can get wrong again. It cannot tell whether a workflow
is passing; it can tell whether a failure would arrive in time to matter.

Confirmed by injection: restoring `branches: [main]` under `push` in
`ci.yml` fails `test_a_gating_workflow_fires_before_the_merge` naming that
file, and removing the `push:` key entirely fails it with the other message.
