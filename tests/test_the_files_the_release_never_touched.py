"""Fifty-five releases, and the phones still say they are version 0.1.0.

0.57.6 ended by naming its own next question: *whatever the guard checks, ask
first which files it does not open.* This is that question asked of the
release itself rather than of a guard.

A cut bumps `pyproject.toml`, `<pkg>/api.py`, `app/package.json`, the
lock file, the README banner, the README release row and the changelog. Seven
files, and the number reaches everything a *server* or a *console* reports.
The three native shells report their own version from three build files no
step in that list touches:

    native/ios/project.yml          MARKETING_VERSION: "0.1.0"
    native/android/…/build.gradle.kts   versionName = "0.1.0"
    native/windows/*.csproj         (no <Version> at all)

Nine declarations across three products, every one of them 0.1.0 or absent,
through every release since the shells were written.

    asked     does the product carry the version it cut
    mattered  does the thing a person installs carry it

This is not cosmetic in the way a stale README is. `versionName` is the string
on the Play listing and in Settings › Apps; `MARKETING_VERSION` is the App
Store version and the one a crash report is filed against; the `.csproj`
version is the file version Windows shows in Properties. An install that
reports 0.1.0 cannot be told apart from any other install, so a problem report
from the field names nothing — and this repo *has* a problem collector, which
is the part that makes the omission bite.

`versionCode` is worse still: Android refuses an upload whose code is not
greater than the last one, so a store submission was going to fail on the
first try regardless of what the listing said.

## The other thing these files hold

The same files carry what the shell is allowed to do — the plist usage
strings, the `uses-permission` rows. Those are checked here too, because they
have the identical property: no guard opens them, and getting one wrong is
fatal rather than untidy. iOS **terminates** an app that opens a camera with
no `NSCameraUsageDescription`. Android throws `SecurityException`.

Both are complete right now in all three products, and the check exists so
that the next screen to open a microphone cannot ship without the sentence
that lets it.

### One trap, walked into while writing this

The first pass at the capability check read `LAContext` in QRME's
`Signing.swift` and `BiometricPrompt` in `Signing.kt` and was ready to report
two missing declarations. Both are in **comments** — prose explaining why the
shells use WebAuthn instead, since a local biometric check is the app's own
word about itself and an assertion is not. A guard that counts a mention as a
use invents a defect, which is worse than missing one. Comments are stripped
before anything is counted, and `test_a_platform_api_named_in_a_comment_is_not_a_use`
holds that line.
