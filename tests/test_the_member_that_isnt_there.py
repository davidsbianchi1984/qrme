"""Every screen reaches for the same few objects. Nothing checked what they hold.

0.58.0 ended by restating the standing gap: there is no Swift, Kotlin or C#
toolchain on this machine, so the native UI is asserted by reading and not by
running, and that round widened the amount of screen riding on it. The honest
response is not to pretend a compiler exists. It is to find the classes of
compile error that can be caught by reading, and close them one at a time —
0.57.5 took duplicate declarations and unbalanced braces, 0.57.6 took the
markup. This takes the next one.

## The receivers whose type is known for free

Most expressions in these trees need a type checker to judge. A few do not.
Where a screen names an object that exactly one file declares, the member it
asks for can be looked up without resolving anything:

    iOS      `state.x`                `AppState.swift`
             `ApiClient.shared.x`     `ApiClient.swift`
             `Theme.x`                `Theme.swift`
    Android  `vm.x`                   `AppState.kt`
             `ApiClient.x`            `ApiClient.kt`
             `Qrme.x`                 `ui/Theme.kt`
    Windows  `AppState.Current.X`     `AppState.cs`
             `ApiClient.Shared.X`     `ApiClient.cs`
             `{StaticResource X}`     `App.xaml`

A member one of these does not declare is not a style question. Swift says
*value of type 'AppState' has no member 'userId'*, Kotlin says *unresolved
reference*, and the shell does not build.

    asked     do the screens parse, and do they say the right things
    mattered  is the thing they reach for actually there

## What the first run found

Thirty-eight call sites across six files in two products, all on the iPhone:

* JIM-mini's `AppState` holds `uid` and `token`; five screens asked it for
  `userId` and `userToken`. Continuity, presence, safety and the synthetic
  self — the whole crisis half of the product.
* `state.api` in JIM-mini and PDI, on an `AppState` that has no client at
  all. Every other screen in both trees reaches `ApiClient.shared`.

Not one of them compiles, and all of them had been sitting in `main`.

## What widening it to the other receivers found

One more, and it is the cheapest kind of break there is. QRME's Android
problem-report card painted itself with `Qrme.Card2`; the theme declares
`Card` and has never declared a second. Both sibling products paint the same
card with `Card`, so it was a one-character slip that no amount of reading
the diff would have caught — and Compose has no fallback for an unresolved
colour, so the whole screen file fails to compile with it.

The API clients came back clean: 1,613 call sites across nine shells, every
one of them naming a method the client actually has. That is worth asserting
anyway. The value of a guard is not only what it finds on the day it is
written — 0.58.1's own defect had been in `main` for rounds.

## The trap this walked into first

The first extractor reported four more: `call` on the Kotlin view models and
`IsSignedIn` / `IsEnrolled` on the C# ones. Both were the reader's fault —
`fun <T> call(` puts a type parameter between the keyword and the name, and
`public bool IsSignedIn => …` is an expression-bodied property with no `{` or
`(` after it. A guard that reports four defects that are not there is one
nobody reads, which is the lesson this repository keeps relearning. Both
shapes are matched now, and tested for below.
