"""Every screen reaches for the same object. Nothing checked what it holds.

0.58.0 ended by restating the standing gap: there is no Swift, Kotlin or C#
toolchain on this machine, so the native UI is asserted by reading and not by
running, and that round widened the amount of screen riding on it. The honest
response is not to pretend a compiler exists. It is to find the classes of
compile error that can be caught by reading, and close them one at a time —
0.57.5 took duplicate declarations and unbalanced braces, 0.57.6 took the
markup. This takes the next one.

## The one thing every screen touches

Each shell has exactly one object the screens read their session from, and
exactly one file that declares it:

    iOS      `AppState`            `@EnvironmentObject var state`  → `state.x`
    Android  the view model        `vm: StudioViewModel`           → `vm.x`
    Windows  `AppState.Current`    a singleton                     → `.Current.X`

So `state.x` is not a guess about types — it is the one receiver in these
trees whose declaration is known without resolving anything. A member it does
not declare is not a style question. Swift says *value of type 'AppState' has
no member 'userId'*, and the shell does not build.

    asked     do the screens parse, and do they say the right things
    mattered  is the thing they reach for actually there

## What the first run found

Thirty-eight call sites across six files in two products, all on the iPhone:

* JIM-mini's `AppState` holds `uid` and `token`; five screens asked it for
  `userId` and `userToken`. Continuity, presence, safety and the synthetic
  self — the whole crisis half of the product.
* `state.api` in JIM-mini and PDI, on an `AppState` that has no client at
  all. Every other screen in both trees reaches `ApiClient.shared`.

Not one of them compiles, and all of them had been sitting in `main`.

## The trap this walked into first

The first extractor reported four more: `call` on the Kotlin view models and
`IsSignedIn` / `IsEnrolled` on the C# ones. Both were the reader's fault —
`fun <T> call(` puts a type parameter between the keyword and the name, and
`public bool IsSignedIn => …` is an expression-bodied property with no `{` or
`(` after it. A guard that reports four defects that are not there is one
nobody reads, which is the lesson this repository keeps relearning. Both
shapes are matched now, and tested for below.
