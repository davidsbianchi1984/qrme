"""A header a route needs is a header its callers send.

## Where this came from

0.58.0 asked whether the three shells sent every header the console sent, and
found `x-llm-api-key` in one client and no other. It has held since, and this
round found what it cannot see.

**Parity is a relative check, and a relative check is satisfied by everyone
being equally wrong.** Every client in this product agreed about
`x-tenant-key`: none of them sent it outside two bequest calls. The comparison
passed. The vault was unusable.

    asked     do the clients send the same headers as each other
    mattered  do the clients send the headers the routes require

## What it was, next door

The instance is PDI's and the shape is the estate's. A tenant there that moved
its vault under a customer-managed key locked **every client in that product**
out of every record — console and all three shells alike — because
`x-tenant-key` is required by the auth dependency and was sent by nobody
outside two heir routes. The comparison 0.58.0 wrote passed the whole time:
the clients agreed with each other.

This product has no such header today. The file is here because the question
is not about that header, and a guard that arrives after the second instance
is a guard that was written twice.

## What this asks instead

The requirement is read from the **application**, not from any client:
FastAPI already resolves each route's header parameters through its whole
dependency tree, so `_tenant`'s `x_tenant_key` is attributed to every route
that depends on it, and `_writer`'s to everything under that. Nothing here
parses Python to work it out, and nothing here can be satisfied by a client.

Then, per client, per route that client actually calls: can it send what the
route requires? A client that has no door to a route is not asked about its
headers — this is a question about the clients that go there.

## The record

`unsendable_headers.txt` carries the pairs that are deliberate. There is one
kind so far, and it needs a reason rather than a shrug: a header no client is
*meant* to send, because the route is not for a client. Every row names the
client and the header, and the ceiling only comes down.
