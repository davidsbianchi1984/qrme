"""A page never prints what it was given.

0.59.3 found reflected cross-site scripting on the sign-in callback by
sweeping every f-string that builds markup — by hand, once, and then throwing
the sweep away. Escaping is the first line of defence and the policy is the
second; that round shipped the second and left the first unguarded.

    asked     is this page correct
    mattered  can the next value somebody interpolates be markup

## What the sweep does

It walks every f-string in this package whose literal parts contain real
markup, and reports each interpolation whose expression does not reach an
escape. "Reaches" is followed properly rather than looked for on the same
line, because most of this estate escapes one line above the template:

    ref = html.escape(card["reference"])
    body = f'<p class="ref">{ref}</p>'

A sweep that only asked whether `html.escape` appears inside the braces
reported 32 rows in this product, of which six were the defect and the rest
were that pattern. Following single assignments, and functions whose every
return is escaped, cuts it to eight — and all eight are composites the
analysis cannot follow rather than values anybody reads.

## Two things it deliberately does not do

**It does not read prose as markup.** The first draft matched any f-string
containing `<` and `>`, which flagged a WebAuthn diagnostic containing
`http://localhost:<port>`. It now wants a closing tag, or an opening tag
carrying an attribute.

**It does not decide.** The rows below are recorded, not fixed. Whether
`{body}` is safe depends on how `body` was built three functions ago, and
that is a reading a person does once and writes down — which is what the
record is for. What the ratchet guarantees is that the **next** one fails on
the day it is written rather than four hundred releases later.
