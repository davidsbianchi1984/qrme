"""One English sentence, two keys, and the two copies no longer agree.

## The finding

Three releases of this arc have been about the same thing: the measurement was
reading one shape and calling the rest finished. 0.47.9 ended by correcting
what a number *meant* — 263 of the 335 rows in `native_dead_keys.txt` are not
waste but cross-shell asymmetry, a row one shell holds and another shell's
screen has not been built to use yet.

This round asks the next question about those 263, and the answer is worse
than asymmetry. **Sixty of them are a sentence the shell already says under a
different key.** `nc.find` is dead on the iPhone and on Android; the Windows
shell uses it for the Community screen's join button. The iPhone has that same
button and calls it `nc.match.find`. Same screen, same button, two rows, two
translations:

| | Windows (`nc.find`) | iPhone (`nc.match.find`) |
|---|---|---|
| es | Buscar una coincidencia | Buscar a alguien |
| fr | Trouver une mise en relation | Trouver un binôme |
| de | Eine Verbindung suchen | Gegenüber finden |

An English reader sees one product. A Spanish reader sees a different button
on the phone than on the desktop, for the same press.

Counted across the whole table rather than only the dead rows, QRME carries 54
English strings under two or more keys on iOS, 55 on Android and 60 on
Windows — around 215 redundant rows, which is 2,150 translations maintained
twice. **In forty-three of the fifty-four iOS sets the copies have already
drifted.** Redundancy is not the defect. Drift is: redundancy only means
somebody will have to do the work twice, while drift means it has already been
done twice and come out differently, and a reader is looking at the difference.

    asked     is every string on the screen translated
    mattered  does the product say the same thing twice the same way

## A duplicate is a question, not a defect

This guard deliberately does not ban duplicates, and it does not demand that
every duplicate be reconciled. Three different things produce one English
string under two keys, and only the last is a bug:

1. **English hides the gender.** `ava.show`, `cam.show`, `lend.show`,
   `org.show` and `work.show` all read *Show it*. Spanish has to choose
   *Mostrarlo* or *Mostrarla* depending on what *it* is — an avatar, a camera,
   a loan, an organization, a workshop. Five rows is the correct number of
   rows. Collapsing them would be a regression that the English cannot see.

2. **One English word is two words.** `counter.trade` is a *trade* as in a
   craft — *Oficio*, *Métier*, *Gewerk*, 手艺. `tab.trade` is trade as in
   commerce — *Comercio*, *Négoce*, 交易. The translations are right and the
   English is wrong: one word doing two jobs. Recorded by name, because the
   fix is to change the English, which changes what is on the screen.

3. **The same thing said two ways for no reason.** *Refresh* is
   *ताज़ा करें* on two screens and *रीफ़्रेश* on a third. *Send* is *إرسال*
   under two keys and *أرسل* under three. Nobody decided this. **This is the
   defect**, and 0.48.0 reconciles it.

So the record below holds rows, not a bare count, and each row can be read and
argued with. The ratchet is on the total, in the direction that matters: the
number of split wordings may not rise.

## The two tabs with the same name

The measurement turned up one thing nobody was looking for. `tab.counter` and
`tab.desk` are two different entries in the same tab bar — the Counter and the
Desk — and in Spanish both read *Mostrador*, in French both *Comptoir*, in
Portuguese both *Balcão*. Three languages in which this product's own tab bar
names two destinations identically. The Manage screen's mirror of those tabs
had it right (`nmg.t.counter` is *Ventanilla* / *Guichet* / *Guichê*), which is
how it was found: by asking why the two copies disagreed.

## Where the duplicates came from

Some of them came from this audit. 0.47.6 wired 91 Android sites that Compose
had hidden from the extractor, and did it by inserting new rows — `nmg.t.desk`,
`nmg.t.gaming`, `nmg.t.sign` — beside `tab.desk`, `tab.gaming` and `nsig.sign`,
which already held those words. 0.47.7 hit a key collision on
`nmg.filter.industry` and renamed its way around it to `nmg.f.industry`
instead of reconciling the two rows. Both are in the record below under my own
hand. The rule this round adds is the one that would have stopped them: before
inserting a row, look for the sentence.

## What this file checks

1. **no new split wordings** — the measured set matches `native_split_wordings.txt`
   exactly, in both directions: a new one fails, and one that has been
   reconciled must be struck from the record rather than left to rot;
2. **the total only shrinks** — against the `# ceiling:` the record carries;
3. **the extraction still reads the tables** — every false pass in this audit
   came from a pattern that quietly stopped matching, so the parse is checked
   against a known row before anything is concluded from it;
4. **no unbraced unicode escape in the Swift table** — see below.

## The thing found by asking why two copies differed

`people.say` and `party.say` both read *Say something*. Their Italian differed,
so the measurement printed both, and one of them was:

    "it": "Di\\u0027 qualcosa"

A literal `\\u0027` — the JSON escape for an apostrophe — sitting in a Swift
string literal, where the escape is `\\u{0027}` and `\\u0027` is not a valid
escape sequence at all. `L10n.swift` does not compile. There is no Swift
toolchain in this repo's CI, so nothing has said so; the Android and Windows
tables carry the same row correctly. It reached the file through some
long-forgotten JSON round-trip, and it was found by comparing a sentence with
its own twin.
