"""A 422 returned what the caller sent, on a product that records nothing.

## The finding

The round before this one put every refusal the product *writes* into the
reader's language, through one handler no raise site opts into. It missed
every refusal the product *returns*.

    asked     is every refusal this product writes translated
    mattered  is every refusal this product returns

`RequestValidationError` is not an `HTTPException`. FastAPI raises it before
routing finishes and renders it with its own handler, so a 422 — the refusal a
person meets most often, because it is what a mistyped form produces — went
out in English past a handler written to catch everything.

## The larger half

Pydantic's error rows carry an `input` key holding the value that failed, and
for a missing field that value is the **entire submitted body**. The 422
handed it straight back. In JIM:

    {"type": "missing", "loc": ["body", "text"], "msg": "Field required",
     "input": {"entry": "chest pain since Tuesday, have not told my daughter",
               "mood": 3}}

and in PDI, a record value in plaintext, on the one path in an encrypted vault
that never touches the encryption layer.

Every other part of this ecosystem's error design refuses to carry content.
`app/src/errors.ts` and the nine `Problems` modules record a method, a
redacted path and a status, and have no parameter a message could arrive
through — the signature is the safeguard. `cloudgw` refuses a report whole if
it finds prose in it rather than sanitising it. The one place content left the
process was the framework's default renderer, because nobody had looked at it
as ours.

    asked     does this product record anything private
    mattered  does this product return anything private

## What this is, and what it is not

Not disclosure between people. A 422 goes back to whoever sent the request, so
what came back was the sender's own body — nobody read anybody else's data
because of this, and no stored record was exposed. In PDI it could not even
happen unauthenticated: the tenant dependency refuses before the body is
validated.

What it is: content leaving the process on an error path, in a product whose
whole error design exists so that it does not. A response body travels through
whatever sits between the app and the person — a reverse proxy's access log, a
corporate TLS-inspecting middlebox, a HAR export attached to a support ticket,
a browser extension. Every one of those is a place `errors.ts` was written to
keep content out of, and the framework's default renderer put it back.

Severity aside, the reason to fix it is the same reason the intake refuses a
report that holds prose rather than sanitising it: the posture is that content
does not travel, and a posture with one documented exception is a preference.

## How this is checked

Not by asserting the absence of the `input` key — a check on the name of the
leak rather than on the leak. `test_nothing_a_caller_sent_comes_back` posts a
canary string to **every route in the table that takes a body**, from
`all_routes`, and fails if the canary appears anywhere in the response at all.
A future key under a different name is caught by the same test, without anyone
editing it.
