"""Entering your own key says you start paying for it.

David, on the beta's arrangement, in his own words:

    "I want all devices that use this app or website to default and
     mandatorily use my personal API keys we are currently using and
     passwords, allowing users for the time being to use my API keys and
     password for beta testing... notified them that they will be charging
     their own accounts instead of using these free API keys and passwords
     that I'm letting them use to pay a test on my dollar."

    asked     can somebody use their own key
    mattered  do they know what changes when they do

The default is deliberate: the deployment's own keys, spent by its owner,
so a tester can try the thing without producing a card. Nothing about
that is a secret and nothing about it is a trap — until somebody types
their own key into the box and the bill silently moves to them.

So the sentence lives **at the box**, not in terms nobody opens. It is
one paragraph under the input, and it says three things: whose keys you
are on now, that their owner is paying, and that the charges become yours
from the moment you save your own.
