"""One wire name, one meaning — and the type checker nobody was running.

`spoken` meant three things in this ecosystem at once:

* `guardian.guide_first_aid` → the CPR playbook steps read aloud, a **string
  list**;
* `presence.deepen` → the model's rewritten line, a **string**;
* `presence.say` → whether the beat was said out loud, a **boolean**.

The Windows client had already forked it into three records, each with its own
`JsonPropertyName("spoken")`, and nothing about that forking looked wrong to
anybody reading one record at a time. TypeScript could not fork it, because
`PresenceSpoken extends PresenceBeat` there — so the collision surfaced as

    Interface 'PresenceSpoken' incorrectly extends interface 'PresenceBeat'.
      Types of property 'spoken' are incompatible.
        Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'.

and sat on `main`, because **no suite in any of these three repositories ran
`tsc`**. The one tool able to see the problem was the one tool nobody had
wired up.

    asked     do the clients compile
    mattered  does anybody ever run the compiler

## The two guards here

`test_the_console_typechecks` runs `tsc --noEmit`. It costs about six seconds
and it is the direct fix: this defect cannot reach `main` again without
somebody deleting this test.

`test_no_wire_name_carries_two_types` is the general shape. It reads every
`JsonPropertyName` in the Windows client — the only file in this codebase
where the whole wire surface is declared with its types — and records names
that carry more than one. The record is ratcheted.

## Why the Windows client is the source of truth

Not because it is more correct, but because it is the most *complete
statement*. Swift decodes into structs spread across a file, Kotlin parses
`JSONObject` by hand, and TypeScript interfaces are erased at runtime. C#
records with `JsonPropertyName` are the one place a reader can see every wire
name and its type together, which is what makes the collision countable.
