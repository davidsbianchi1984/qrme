"""Ability is not a gate — and the statement that says so is checked here.

The accessibility statement (README, console Access screen, terms) makes
claims about behavior: reports need no account and keep no name, the
reports are read by somebody standing for the deployment, every image in
the console says what it shows, and the known gaps live in a ledger that
only shrinks. A statement is marketing until a test fails when it stops
being true. These are those tests.

The same four questions are asked in all three products — the guard
travels, per ``shared_guards.txt`` — with each suite answering for its own
console, its own routes and its own ledger.
