"""One contract, three copies — the header a stranger's browser sends.

## Why this file is byte-identical in three repositories

QRME, JIM-mini and PDI each grew a `negotiate()` in a different round, for a
different surface, written from scratch each time: the objector's screen, the
beacon page a passer-by kneels over, the sticker on a sealed carrier. Same
input, same job, three implementations — and the person they serve is
frequently the *same person*, holding one phone, meeting whichever of the
three products the situation put in front of them.

Three copies of one contract drift. Ours already had:

    ar;q=0        qrme en   jim ar   pdi en
    de;q=abc      qrme en   jim de   pdi en

`q=0` means **not acceptable** — RFC 9110 says so plainly — so a browser
sending `ar;q=0` is refusing Arabic. JIM answered in it, on the page somebody
reads while deciding what to do for a person on the floor. It appended every
recognised tag to the ranking regardless of quality, so a header that refused
the only language it named got that language back.

Neither product was checking. Each had its own table of header cases and each
one passed, because each was asking whether *its* implementation did what
*its* author expected. That is this audit's recurring shape across a
repository boundary:

    asked     does this product read the header correctly
    mattered  do the three read it the same way

## What is checked

The table below is the contract. It is not a description of what these
functions happen to do — several rows failed when it was first written. Any
row that disagrees with any product is a defect in that product, and the fix
is to make the product match, not to soften the row.

Copy this file verbatim when adding a fourth product. It imports its own
package by name and nothing else, so the only edit is the import.
