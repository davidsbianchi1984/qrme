"""`test_a_binding_is_not_a_door.py`, for the other three clients.

That file exists because `clientpaths.doorless` counts **call sites**, so a
function written in `api.ts` and wired to no screen takes its route off the
backlog whether or not anything ever calls it. Its own docstring puts the cost
plainly:

    A round that adds thirty bindings and five screens will report thirty
    doors and have built five.

It checks `app/src/api.ts`. There are four clients, and the other three have
`ApiClient.swift`, `ApiClient.kt` and `ApiClient.cs` — files of exactly the
same kind, with exactly the same property, and nothing has ever looked at
them.

This is the third time in this audit that a guard turned out to cover one
surface of four. The union guard did it, the door guard did it, and now the
binding guard. The lesson is not that somebody was careless; it is that
"client" reads as singular when you are writing the check and there are four
of them when somebody runs the app.

## What it found on its first run

Eight bindings across the three products, and three of them are the same
shape — a shell that carries the act which **creates** a power and not the act
which **ends** it:

* **QRME, iOS.** `SignatureView` lists your signing credentials and calls
  nothing to revoke one. A signing credential signs documents as you. The
  screen that shows you a credential on a device you no longer hold offers no
  way to take it away.

* **JIM-mini, iOS.** `FamilyView` calls `enrollChild`, `children`,
  `childOverview`, `guardianWatch` and `setFamilyControls`. It does not call
  `unlinkChild`. A guardian can begin watching a child from a phone and cannot
  stop — and a guardian link is a surveillance relationship that outlives the
  reason for it: children grow up, custody changes, households end.

* **PDI, Android and Windows.** `robotKeys` reads what a bound robot has put
  into the vault. Written in both shells, called in neither.

The rest were `health` and `setBase` — genuinely unused plumbing rather than a
capability with no door, and recorded rather than deleted, because the next
shell that needs a backend-URL field will want `setBase` there.
