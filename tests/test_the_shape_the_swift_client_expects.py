"""The same question, asked of the iOS client.

0.56.4 built a guard that drives every GET binding in the **Windows** client
and checks each record against what the route actually returns. 0.56.7 taught
it to check declared types as well as names, and between them they found
nineteen defects in that one file.

Then, by hand, chasing something else:

    struct WearableBoard: Decodable {
        let kinds: [String]?          // the route sends a map
        let refused: [String: String]?
    }
    struct MicVocabularyOut: Decodable {
        let widths: [String: String]?  // no route has ever sent `widths`
    }

iOS was wrong in four places, in exactly the two ways the Windows guard was
built to catch, and **nothing would have told me**. I found them by reading.
The 0.56.7 changelog says so in as many words: *"nothing yet reads Swift or
Kotlin the same way, and that is the next thing this guard is missing."*

    asked     is the client we check correct
    mattered  is every client checked

## Why this is a separate file rather than a parameter

The Windows guard's docstring explains that C# records are the one place in
this codebase where the whole wire surface is declared with its types. That is
still true, and it is why that file reads them. But *only-place* was doing two
jobs in that sentence: the best place to enumerate the surface, and the only
place worth checking. It was never the second.

Swift declares its shapes differently — `struct X: Decodable { let f: T }`,
with the property name doing what `JsonPropertyName` does in C# because this
client sets no key-decoding strategy. So the extractor is this language's, and
`test_the_extractor_reads_the_swift_client` exists because a pattern borrowed
from the C# guard finds nothing here, and nothing found reads as nothing
wrong.

The comparison itself — what shape a JSON value is, and whether a declared
type can decode it — is imported from the Windows guard rather than copied.
Two guards that disagree about what `list` means would be worse than one.
