"""The error reports come home: the product's own backend collects them.

The consoles kept a content-free failure log and the only configured place it
could go was a separate gateway most installs never run. A field report read
"this build has no collector configured, so nothing is sent anywhere" and
asked why the results don't funnel back to where corrections get made. Now
they do: same contract as the gateway (`cloudgw.problems.screen`, verbatim),
folded into counters, readable by the operator and nobody else.
