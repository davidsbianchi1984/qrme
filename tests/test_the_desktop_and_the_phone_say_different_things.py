"""Two tables, one product, and nothing compared them.

## The finding

0.48.0 compared keys *inside* one table and found 54 English strings carried
by two or more keys on iOS, 43 of them already drifted. This round asks the
same question one level out.

The desktop console has its own table — `app/src/l10n.ts`, 1,882 rows — and
the three shells have theirs. **223 English strings live in both the console
table and the iOS table, and 102 of them had no translation the two tables
agreed on.** Android 104, Windows 103. A person who opens QRME on their laptop
and then on their phone is reading two different products in their own
language, and reading one product in English.

    asked     does each table say the same thing twice the same way
    mattered  do the tables say the same thing as each other

Fifty keys are *the same key in both tables*. Two of those disagreed:
`corner.send` (ar) and `plc.venues` (fr, *Espaces* on the desktop and *Lieux*
on the phone). Identical key, identical English, different word.

## The register

The largest systematic cause is not vocabulary. It is **who the product thinks
it is talking to.**

| German | Sie / Ihnen / Ihre | du / dein / dich |
|---|---|---|
| console | **204** | 32 |
| phone | 7 | **60** |

The desktop addresses a German reader formally and the phone informally. That
is not a synonym choice; in a language with a T–V distinction it is a claim
about the relationship, and this product made both claims at once — *Wo Sie
stehen* on the desktop and *Wo du stehst* on the phone, *Ihre
Signatur-Berechtigungen* against *Deine Signaturberechtigungen*.

Spanish is milder and mostly settled: 20 rows say *usted* against 47 that say
*tú* in the console, 2 against 13 on the phone. French and Portuguese are
formal on both sides; Italian informal on both.

This round moves every row it reconciles onto the phones' wording, which means
onto *du* and *tú*. The whole-table register sweep is recorded rather than
done: converting German T–V is not a pronoun substitution — *Wo Sie stehen*
becomes *Wo du stehst* — and this repo's rule against machine-mangling text a
person relies on applies to 204 rows as much as to fourteen.

## What 0.48.0 did to this number

Widened it. Reconciling the Desk and the Counter inside the native tables
picked *Theke* for the Desk, so that German would stop naming two tab-bar
entries *Schalter*. The console still said *Schalter*, and nothing compared
them, so a fix in one table opened a gap with a table no guard could see.

That is this arc's shape exactly, committed once more inside its own fix, and
it is the argument for this file: the previous round could not have known.

## The measurement was nearly the bug again

The first version of this check compared source bytes. JIM-mini's console
table writes some rows escaped — `"\\u7834\\u68c4\\u3059\\u308b"` — which in
TypeScript **is** 破棄する and renders correctly. Nine of that repo's
thirty-four "disagreements" were the same string spelled two ways, and this
guard would have shipped demanding they be "fixed".

    asked     are these two source strings identical
    mattered  do these two strings render the same

So `_decode` came first and the count came second: JIM's number fell from 34
to 25 before a line of the fix was written. `test_the_escape_decoder_reads_each_syntax`
exists so that a decoder that quietly stopped decoding cannot bring the false
number back.

## What this file checks

1. **the two tables agree** — per shell, matched exactly against
   `console_native_split.txt` in both directions;
2. **the total only shrinks** — against the record's `# ceiling:`;
3. **both tables still parse** — a floor and a probe row, because every false
   pass in this audit came from a pattern that stopped matching;
4. **the decoder still decodes** — on the case that produced the false count.
