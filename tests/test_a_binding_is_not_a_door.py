"""A function in `api.ts` that no screen calls is not a door.

`clientpaths.doorless` counts **call sites**, and `api.ts` is a console source
like any other, so a binding written there takes its route off the backlog
whether or not anything ever calls the binding. The docstring on `doorless`
says so plainly and then gives up:

    The rule that follows is a discipline rather than something the test can
    enforce: add the binding in the same change as the screen that calls it.
    A round that adds thirty bindings and five screens will report thirty
    doors and have built five.

It turns out to be enforceable in about twenty lines, and this is them. The
admission had been sitting there since the route audit was written, which is
its own small lesson: *the test cannot check this* is a claim worth testing.

The check itself is the same question one level down. `doorless` asks whether
the backend's routes are reachable from a client; this asks whether the
client's bindings are reachable from a screen. Twenty-five are not — routes
the audit has been counting as doored that a person cannot get to, because
the only thing that calls them is nothing.

## What it does not claim

Reachability stops here. A binding called by a screen that no tab renders is
still counted, and so is one behind a button that is never enabled. Those are
worth catching too and this is not the file that catches them; what it rules
out is the specific, checkable case of a call that literally does not exist
anywhere.
