"""The synthetic self shipped into three shells, and no shell could show it.

## The finding

Last round put the `self` profile screen on the phones — the one QRME profile
that *is* this person, the surface where they say what their Guardian may pass
on about their medication. One screen per shell, each with its wording in ten
languages, and `test_a_shell_asks_for_a_key_it_has.py` written to prove the
wording was there.

It was there. Nothing else was.

| Shell | Screen | State |
|---|---|---|
| iOS | `SelfProfileSection` | declared; nothing rendered it |
| Android | `SelfProfileScreen` | declared; nothing called it |
| Windows | `SelfProfilePage` | declared; nothing navigated to it |

And on two of the three it would not have compiled if something had. `L10n.t`
takes a key **and a language** in Swift and Kotlin; every one of the forty
calls on those two screens passed only the key. The Windows shell's `L10n.T`
takes the key alone and reads the language itself, which is why that one was
fine — three shells, two spellings of the same function, and a screen written
against the wrong one twice.

    asked     does the screen have its wording
    mattered  does anything open the screen

The previous guard is not wrong; it is one question short. It was written
after keys shipped into the console and not the shells, so it asks about keys.
A screen is reached by three separate things — its strings, its bindings, and
somebody putting it in the navigation — and this audit now has a guard for
each of the first two.

## Why an arity check without a compiler

There is no Swift or Kotlin toolchain in this environment, which is the whole
reason forty calls to a two-parameter function sat in the tree unnoticed. A
source-level check cannot replace a compiler, and this one does not try: it
reads each shell's own localizer for how many parameters it declares, and
holds that shell's call sites to that number. It is the narrowest form of the
question that can be asked here, and it is the exact question that was missed.

## What counts as a screen

The naming convention each shell already keeps: `…View`/`…Section` conforming
to `View` in Swift, `…Screen` composables in Kotlin, `…Page : Page` in C#. A
card is not covered — `OfflinePostureCard` and the rest are components, and
the line has to fall somewhere. Screens are where the convention is uniform
enough to check without inventing one.

Comments are stripped before matching. That is not caution in the abstract:
the version of the offline-posture check written earlier in this same round
passed on `null /* api.offlineStatus() */`, and the version of the egress
check before that passed on a comment containing `offline.enabled()`. A
corpus that contains prose about a name will satisfy a search for that name.

## Why this file is in this repo too

The finding is JIM's; the shape is not. All three products ship the same three
shells, written the same way, and the last four rounds have each turned up a
guard that covered one surface of four. This one is ported before anything
here needs it, which is the point — the two shells it would have caught are in
another repo, and the next one will not be.

This repo's shells are clean of both defects at the time of porting. What it
did surface here is smaller and left as it is: this product's Windows shell
makes exactly two localizer calls, and the reason is recorded on
`test_the_call_extraction_finds_something` rather than fixed under cover of a
round about something else.
