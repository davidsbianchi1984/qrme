"""The localizer's reader, held to a number instead of a hope.

0.58.8 audited the route reader and found the three native shells had no floor
at all — the console had one, written when it was the only client, and the
phones were protected only by whatever block guards happened to name routes
they saw. It closed by naming the next reader with the same shape available
and unused: the one that reads the L10n tables.

That reader has the same hole, and worse numbers.

## What the probe found

`test_a_shell_asks_for_a_key_it_has.py` is a good guard with a floor that has
not moved since it was written. It asserts each shell extracts **at least ten**
localizer calls and holds **at least twenty** table rows, as a canary against
the pattern silently ceasing to match. The tables have since grown to 1087,
1100 and 1115 rows, and the screens to 945, 950 and 961 call sites.

    ten against nine hundred and forty-five

A floor at one percent of the truth is not holding anything. A reader down to
a twentieth of its surface walks past it.

## Why the rest of the file does not cover for it

The three checks around it protect the other two readers and not this one:

* `_held` going blind fails loudly — every key a screen asks for stops being
  in the table, and the first test reports hundreds of missing rows.
* `_reached` going blind or going wide fails loudly — the dead-row set moves
  and the backlog reports undecided or stale rows.
* `_asked` going blind is **silent**, because `_reached` falls back to
  `_MENTIONED`, which finds every dotted string literal in the sources
  whether or not a localizer call is in front of it.

Measured rather than argued. Narrowing the call pattern so it matches only
`L10n.t("…")` — no whitespace, lowercase method — is an ordinary-looking tidy
that blinds C# alone, because Windows spells it `L10n.T(`:

    ios      950 call sites
    android  961 call sites
    windows   52 call sites

294 tests pass. The one failure names four rows — `ncmp`, `ndsk`, `nov`,
`nstu` — as *translated rows nothing asks for*, and those four are found only
because they are the shell's only keys without a dot in them, which
`_MENTIONED` requires. Nothing in that message says the reader stopped
reading. PDI's shells have no dotless keys at all, so there the same blinding
reports nothing whatsoever.

    asked     does every key a screen wants have a row
    mattered  can the reader still see the screens asking

## Two floors, because they fail differently

**Absolute, per shell, on both halves.** Set at roughly four-fifths of what
each reader reaches today. It catches the slow case — a form dropped here, a
suffix there, over several rounds — which no single diff makes obvious.

**A spread across the three shells**, which needs no number chosen by hand.
iOS, Android and Windows are one client written three times: the same screens,
ported by hand, so their tables are near-identical in size. Measured, the
quietest shell sits at 98% of the busiest in this product, 89% in JIM-mini and
77% in PDI. A shell at 5% of its ports is not a smaller shell.

The console is deliberately not a fourth port here, and the reason is measured
rather than assumed: it shares **82 rows** with the shells against 1841 of its
own. The two vocabularies are separate — `app/src/l10n.ts` is the desktop
frame, the shell tables are the phone screens — so neither a spread rule nor a
superset rule between them would mean anything.

## And the debt the backlog records

`native_dead_keys.txt` carries a per-shell count that has never been compared
across shells. The ratchet asks whether the number is going up; it does not
ask whether one shell is carrying far more of it than its ports. Most of those
rows are not waste — the file's own header says so — they are screens that
exist on three shells and say less on one. That is exactly a per-shell
comparison, and it was sitting in the file unmade.

One-sided on purpose: a shell *below* its ports has paid its debt down, which
is the direction this is all for.
