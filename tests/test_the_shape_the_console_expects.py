"""The same question, asked of the client that most people actually use.

0.56.4 through 0.57.0 built this guard three times — for the Windows client's
C# records, the iOS client's Swift structs, and the Android client's `org.json`
reads. Nineteen defects in C#, nine in Swift, eight in Kotlin, and the running
lesson of all three was that fixing a defect in one client is not fixing the
defect.

There is a fourth client. `test_the_console_is_a_client_too.py` next door was
written for exactly this reason — it found that the union of four surfaces was
hiding sixty-four routes a desktop owner could not reach — and it asks whether
the console *calls* each route. It has never asked what the console does with
the answer.

    asked     can the console reach every route
    mattered  does the console read back what the route sends

This client declares more than the other three combined. Every call carries
its expected shape as a type argument:

    req<{ provider: string; effective: string }>(`/profiles/${pid}/model`)

which is the same claim a C# record makes, written differently. And it fails
the same quiet way Kotlin does, for a different reason: TypeScript is erased
at build time, so nothing checks that declaration against reality at runtime.
A field the route does not send is `undefined`, and `{undefined}` in JSX
renders as nothing at all. Not a crash, not a blank where a value should be —
*nothing*, with the layout closing up around it as though the field were never
meant to be there.

## Optional means optional

The Swift guard treats `let x: T?` as a field that must still be present, and
absorbed the difference into a record file of conditional states. That was the
right call there, because that client marks nearly everything optional.

This one does not: it writes `answered?: number` where the field genuinely
comes and goes, and `answered: number` where it does not. So a `?` here is a
declaration that absence is expected, and reporting it as missing would be
reporting the client for being right. Required fields must be on the wire;
optional ones are checked for type when they arrive and left alone when they
do not.

That is a deliberate difference from the sibling guards rather than an
oversight, and it is the reason this one can be read as a list of defects
instead of a list of states.
