## The report

    "It seems to be blocking the PDI menus"

A photograph of the PDI beta on a phone: the vault light sitting squarely
over the first three tabs of the bottom bar, taking the taps. A second
photograph, one state along — *"Same thing with the small green circle when
minimized"* — showed the minimized light doing it as a 40px disc.

This console's corner widgets were moved above the tab bar in an earlier
round, after the same complaint about the agent lights and the help bubble.
The behaviour was right here and the question was not asked here, which is
the shape `guard_divergences.txt` exists to catch: a fix that travelled and
a guard that did not. The stylesheet is now read in all three products.

## Why nothing caught it

Both halves were correct on their own. The light is `position: fixed` at
`bottom: 22px`, which on a desktop is empty page margin. The sidebar becomes
a bottom bar under `@media (max-width: 760px)`, which is the ordinary way to
put navigation on a phone. Neither rule knows about the other, and no test
in this suite had ever read the stylesheet — the console's guards all ask
what a screen *says*, and this was a question about where a thing *sits*.

    asked     is every screen wired, translated and reachable
    mattered  can the person's thumb reach the tab under the light

## What this checks

The bar's height is read out of the stylesheet rather than written here, so
the clearance tracks the bar: if somebody makes the tap targets taller, this
recomputes and the light has to move with them. Anything fixed to the bottom
of the viewport must, inside the mobile block, clear that height.
