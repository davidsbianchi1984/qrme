"""Three products, three suites, and nothing comparing what they ask.

0.59.0 closed on the observation that a literal copied into three
repositories is calibrated for whichever of them was smallest. That is a
special case of something larger: **every guard in this estate exists in
three copies, and the copies drift silently in both directions.** A fix made
in one product and not ported looks exactly like a product that never needed
it.

Nothing anywhere was comparing them.

    asked     does this product pass its own suite
    mattered  do the three suites ask the same questions

## What the first sweep found

370 test-function names are carried by all three products. 140 were carried
by exactly two — and four of those were one defect, in the product that can
least afford it.

`test_serve_cors.py` existed in QRME and JIM-mini and not in PDI, and so did
the code it guards. Both siblings' `serve` opens CORS for a loopback bind
because the packaged console calls the API from its own origin and dies as
"Failed to fetch" otherwise. PDI's frozen backend does the same, so the
**installed** app worked. `python -m pdi serve` — the from-source path — set
nothing.

Measured over HTTP with the console's origin on the request, because CORS is
a browser rule and an in-process test client never sends an `Origin` at all:

    OPTIONS /terms   →  405, no access-control headers
    GET     /terms   →  200, no access-control-allow-origin

Every in-process test in that product passed throughout.

## Why a recorded manifest rather than a live comparison

The three repositories are rarely checked out together, so a live comparison
skips in CI. This estate already learned that lesson once — the sibling
vocabulary check in `test_the_refusal_names_the_field_on_the_form.py` carries
a comment saying its first draft looked in the wrong place and skipped every
run, and *a check that never runs is not a check*.

So the shared vocabulary is written down. `shared_guards.txt` lists what all
three carry and `guard_divergences.txt` lists what exactly two do, naming the
product that lacks each one. Both are byte-identical in the three
repositories. Every product can then check its own half alone:

* every name in the manifest must exist here;
* every divergence naming *another* product must exist here, because it is
  carried by two of the three and this is not the one that lacks it;
* every divergence naming *this* product must be absent here, so a port that
  lands without being recorded fails rather than passing quietly.

Three checks, no siblings required. The live three-way comparison runs on top
of that whenever the siblings are on disk.

## A name is not a behaviour

This compares function names. A guard ported under a different name reads as
missing; one that kept its name while its body was gutted reads as present.
PDI reports its version from `/health` under a differently-named test, and
this file would call that a gap if the record did not hold it as a row.

That limit is worth the check anyway, because the failure it catches is the
one that actually happens: not a renamed guard, but a fix that never
travelled.
