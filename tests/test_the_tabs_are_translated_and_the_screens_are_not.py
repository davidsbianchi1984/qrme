"""The tab bar answers in your language. Everything behind it does not.

## The finding

`test_the_nav_is_translated_and_nothing_behind_it_is.py` in the sibling
product found this in a **console**: forty-six translated sidebar labels, and
1577 English strings on the screens they open. Its docstring says why that is
worse than no translation at all —

    A uniformly English console tells a Spanish reader the truth on the first
    screen they see. This one puts *Mercado*, *Amigos* and *Ajustes* in the
    sidebar — the app apparently answering in their language — and then hands
    them English the moment they click.

Three products ship three native shells each. All nine have a translated tab
bar. Nobody had ever counted what is behind them.

| product | iOS | Android | Windows |
|---|---|---|---|
| QRME | 2.4% | 3.8% | **0.6%** |
| JIM-mini | 13.0% | 14.2% | 9.7% |
| PDI | 8.9% | 10.2% | 3.5% |

    asked     is the console's nav-vs-behind gap measured
    mattered  is the phones' too

Nine surfaces, and the guard existed for one of them — the same shape the last
five rounds each turned up, which is why it is now ported to all three repos
in the same round it was written.

## Why the alarm surface was fixed and the rest was recorded

1813 strings cannot be hand-translated in one round, and this repo's own rule
forbids the other kind: `jim/i18n.py` says safety text is *"never
machine-mangled"*. So this round takes the subset where English is a hazard
rather than a discourtesy, and records the rest honestly.

The **alarm surface** is that subset — fourteen strings, translated into ten
languages, wired into all three shells:

* the question the crash watch asks (*"JIM is asking: are you okay?"*) and its
  answer, on a screen whose whole premise is that silence sends help;
* the three answers to an open alarm — *I have this — I'm going*, *Nobody can
  go — escalate*, *It's over — clear it* — one of which decides whether a
  ladder keeps climbing toward emergency services;
* *"This is not an emergency service. If it is one, call your local emergency
  number — this screen cannot."*

A Spanish speaker was being shown *Seguridad* on the tab and then asked, in
English, whether they were alright, with three English buttons deciding what
happens next. The backend already refuses in nine languages and promises in
all of them that emergency paths are never affected.

    asked     is the chrome localized
    mattered  is the decision localized

All three shells or none, for the reason `native_untranslated.txt` already
gives: porting one puts the responder on a localized iPhone and an English
Android, which is the per-client mistake this audit is named for, made on
purpose.

## What this file checks

Three things, and only the first is a measurement:

1. **the count only shrinks** — per shell, against `native_screens_untranslated.txt`;
2. **the extraction still matches** — every false pass in this audit came from
   a pattern that quietly stopped finding anything;
3. **every slot survives translation** — a row whose English carries `{name}`
   and whose German does not renders a sentence with the person's name missing
   from the middle of an alarm. The backend has had this check for its own
   templates since the stranger's-language round; the shells never did.

## Why this file is in this repo too

The finding spans all nine shells; the fix that came with it is the sibling
product's. This repo gets the measurement, the ratchet and the slot check now,
in the same round, because the surfaces are the same three shells written the
same way and the last five rounds each turned up a guard that covered one of
four.
