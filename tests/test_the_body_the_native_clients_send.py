"""The same question as 0.57.2, asked of the three clients it could not read.

0.57.2 checked what the *console* sends against the model FastAPI validates
with, and closed by noting that the finding which motivated it — a field all
four clients sent and no model declared — had been visible only because I read
the four clients by hand. The guard read one.

    asked     does the console send a body the route can accept
    mattered  does any client send a body the route can accept

So this file reads the other three. The comparison is identical and imported
from the console guard; only the extraction differs, and it has to, because
these clients do not resemble each other:

    C#      Post($"/organizations", new { name }, token)
    Swift   request("/rooms", method: "POST", body: ["topic": t])
    Kotlin  request("/profiles/$id/compose", "POST", JSONObject().put("topic", t))

Three languages, three shapes, one question. 0.56.5 established that a
borrowed pattern must be re-written per client rather than re-pointed, and
every release since has re-proved it; this file assumes it from the start.

## The anonymous-object trap

C# infers a property name when it is not given:

    new { name }                        // a property called `name`
    new { learner_id = learnerId }      // a property called `learner_id`

Reading only the `x = y` form found the second and missed the first, which
meant eleven routes were accused of never sending fields they send on every
call. That is the fifth time in this arc that the extractor, not the client,
produced the findings — and the first four were caught the same way this one
was: by looking at a result that was too dramatic to be true, and checking it
against the file.

## Why the reach floors are the important assertions

A body this guard cannot read is a body it does not judge, so an extractor
that quietly stops matching reports a clean client rather than failing. The
floors below are what each client honestly yields today. They are not
decoration: 0.57.2's two real findings existed only on the far side of a
reach fix, and were invisible while the guard was green.
