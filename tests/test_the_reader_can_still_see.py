"""The instrument, not the code: can each reader still see?

0.58.7 found a missing brace by auditing a reader rather than the thing it
read, and closed by naming the general case: **a blind instrument is
indistinguishable from a clean repository.** Every guard in this estate has a
reader. The route audit's is the oldest and the most load-bearing — six other
files ask `clientpaths` what each client calls, and a route table read short
narrows all of them at once, silently, in the safe direction.

## What the probe found

The console *is* protected. `test_the_audit_is_actually_looking_at_something`
asserts `calls(CONSOLE) > 200`, written when the console was the only client,
and blinding the console's template-literal reader drops it 351 → 74 and fails
four tests including that one.

The three native shells have **no floor at all.** Their protection is
incidental: a scatter of per-block and per-form tests written by earlier rounds
that happen to name routes those readers see. Blinding the iOS `request(`
form drops it 430 → 11 call sites, and what fails is a handful of block guards
— not one of them saying *the iOS reader has stopped reading*. A narrowing
that misses the blocks those tests happen to cover passes in silence.

    asked     do the clients call every route
    mattered  can the reader still see the clients

## Two floors, because they fail differently

**An absolute floor per client.** Set at roughly four-fifths of what each
reader sees today. It catches the slow case — a reader narrowed over several
rounds until it covers a fraction of the surface — which no single diff would
make obvious.

**A spread check across the three native shells.** iOS, Android and Windows
are one client written three times — the same screens, the same routes, ported
by hand. When one drops far below the other two while they hold, that is the
reader breaking and not the shell shrinking, and it needs no number chosen by
hand to say so.

The console is deliberately outside that comparison, and the reason is
measured rather than assumed: JIM-mini's console extracts 251 call sites
against 114 on each phone, and PDI's 121 against 35. Those consoles carry
surface the phones do not, so a spread rule spanning all four would have to be
loosened until it caught nothing. The absolute floor is what holds the console.

The floors would let all readers drift down together; the spread would let all
three shells break together. Neither happens by accident.

## The floors are ratchets, not targets

They record what the reader reaches today. Raising one when a client grows is
ordinary; lowering one is a deliberate edit that shows up in a diff, and the
only honest reason to do it is a client that genuinely got smaller.
