"""`req<T>` is a cast, and a cast is a claim about the server nothing checks.

## Where this came from

0.59.6 read the requirement out of the application — which headers a route
needs — and asked whether the callers could meet it. This is the same
question pointed the other way: the route **answers** with a shape, the screen
**declares** one, and between them sits `req<T>`, which is a TypeScript cast.
A cast type-checks against nothing. The compiler is satisfied; the screen
crashes.

    asked     does this call compile
    mattered  is the shape it names the shape that arrives

## What it was, next door

The instance is the siblings' and the shape is the estate's.
`GET /hosting/{tenant_id}/history` in PDI answers with an **object**:

    {"tenant_id": "ten_…", "history": [ … ]}

and its Custody screen called `.map` on it — `TypeError: history.map is not a
function`, thrown during render, on any vault that had ever been moved.
JIM-mini had the same on `GET /users/{uid}/referral/clinicians`, where the
object also carried a `reason` for an empty list that nobody had ever seen,
because the screen threw before reaching it.

This console agrees with its backend on all four hundred and twenty-two typed
calls, and the one place it hedges — `{comments: C[]} | C[]` — names both
shapes on purpose and is not counted against it.

## Why the existing guards do not cover it

The route audit asks whether a path resolves and whether a method is
accepted. The door audit asks whether a route has a screen. Both were fully
satisfied here: the path resolved, the method matched, the screen existed and
called it. Nothing asked what came back.

`tsc` cannot help either, and that is the point rather than an oversight:
`req<T>` is generic over a type the caller supplies, and the body is parsed
with `JSON.parse`, which returns `any`. The cast is exactly where the type
system stops.

## What this reads

Per **call expression**, not per path. The first cut of this sweep keyed on
the path literal and reported sixty-odd disagreements, every one of them the
reader pairing a `POST` with the `GET` that shares its path. Reading each
`req<T>(…)` call and taking the verb out of *that* call's own body dropped it
to one per product, and all three of those were real.

A union that names both shapes satisfies either: `{comments: C[]} | C[]` is a
client that handles what arrives, which is defensive rather than wrong.
