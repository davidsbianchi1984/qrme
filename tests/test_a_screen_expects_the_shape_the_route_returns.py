"""`req<T>` is a cast, and a cast is a claim about the server nothing checks.

## Where this came from

0.59.6 read the requirement out of the application — which headers a route
needs — and asked whether the callers could meet it. This is the same
question pointed the other way: the route **answers** with a shape, the screen
**declares** one, and between them sits `req<T>`, which is a TypeScript cast.
A cast type-checks against nothing. The compiler is satisfied; the screen
crashes.

    asked     does this call compile
    mattered  is the shape it names the shape that arrives

## What it was, next door

The instance is the siblings' and the shape is the estate's.
`GET /hosting/{tenant_id}/history` in PDI answers with an **object**:

    {"tenant_id": "ten_…", "history": [ … ]}

and its Custody screen called `.map` on it — `TypeError: history.map is not a
function`, thrown during render, on any vault that had ever been moved.
JIM-mini had the same on `GET /users/{uid}/referral/clinicians`, where the
object also carried a `reason` for an empty list that nobody had ever seen,
because the screen threw before reaching it.

This console agrees with its backend on all four hundred and twenty-two typed
calls, and the one place it hedges — `{comments: C[]} | C[]` — names both
shapes on purpose and is not counted against it.

## Why the existing guards do not cover it

The route audit asks whether a path resolves and whether a method is
accepted. The door audit asks whether a route has a screen. Both were fully
satisfied here: the path resolved, the method matched, the screen existed and
called it. Nothing asked what came back.

`tsc` cannot help either, and that is the point rather than an oversight:
`req<T>` is generic over a type the caller supplies, and the body is parsed
with `JSON.parse`, which returns `any`. The cast is exactly where the type
system stops.

## What this reads

Per **call expression**, not per path. The first cut of this sweep keyed on
the path literal and reported sixty-odd disagreements, every one of them the
reader pairing a `POST` with the `GET` that shares its path. Reading each
`req<T>(…)` call and taking the verb out of *that* call's own body dropped it
to one per product, and all three of those were real.

A union that names both shapes satisfies either: `{comments: C[]} | C[]` is a
client that handles what arrives, which is defensive rather than wrong.

## 0.59.8: one client of four

The paragraph above describes what this file did when it was written, and it
was written against the console alone. The three shells decode the same
answers into their own types, and a wrong one there is the same failure with
a different stack trace — `JSONArray` on an object throws exactly like `.map`
on one.

Extending it multiplied the comparisons by four, and the interesting part was
not the disagreements — there were none — but how unevenly the clients can be
read at all:

    QRME       console 422   ios 300   android 316   windows 342
    JIM-mini   console 245   ios  89   android   3   windows  88
    PDI        console 116   ios  31   android  24   windows  20

JIM-mini's Android shell names a shape on three calls out of a hundred and
fourteen, because it discards the body on the rest. That is not a reader
failing — a client that never reads an answer cannot be wrong about it — but
three and three hundred cannot share a floor, so the per-client reach is a
**record** that must not go down rather than a number chosen by hand.
