"""One home for the numbers that say *the reader is still reading*.

## Where this came from

Two rounds running found the same defect in two different instruments, and
0.58.9 closed by naming the general case rather than the instance: a floor
written when the surface was small, never raised as the surface grew. The
route reader's floor was set when the console was the only client. The
localizer's was ten, against nine hundred and forty-five.

Both were fixed one file at a time. This is the sweep, and the sweep needed a
convention before it needed code, because a floor is spelled a dozen ways —
`assert len(found) > 20`, `assert total >= 40`, a `FLOORS` tuple, a bare
`_MIN_PATHS`. Nothing could walk them all and ask the only question that
matters about a floor:

    asked     is the number satisfied
    mattered  is the number still near what it measures

## What a Ratchet is

A floor plus **the way to measure the same quantity now**. That second half is
the whole convention: a number with no attached measurement cannot be audited,
which is why 91 of them in this product had drifted to a fiftieth of the truth
without anything noticing.

Registering one has three effects. The number lives in one place instead of
inside an assertion. `test_a_floor_is_within_sight_of_what_it_measures.py`
checks it against reality every run. And it leaves the unregistered-floor
backlog, which only shrinks.

## What the sweep found on its first run

Every reachable floor in the estate was decoration by the standard 0.58.8 set
for itself — a floor below half of what it measures is not holding anything:

    l10n asked, per shell        10 against 945-961     ratio 0.01
    l10n held, per shell         20 against 1087-1115   ratio 0.02
    path literals, all surfaces  40 against 1407        ratio 0.03
    console call sites          200 against 429         ratio 0.47

The last is the one worth reading twice. 0.58.8 wrote that *the console is
protected* and built that round on it. It is protected against being blinded
outright. It was never protected against being halved, and half of a route
reader is half an audit.

`test_the_console_is_a_client_too.py` carried the reason in its own docstring:
the floor of twenty was set low deliberately *because the three products'
shells differ by a factor of three in size*. One number written to work in
three repositories at once is a number set by the smallest of them — 20 held
against PDI's thirty-four bindings and against QRME's four hundred and thirty
equally, which is to say it held nothing here.

That is why these live per product, measured per product, and not in a shared
constant.

## The floors are ratchets, not targets

Each records what its reader reaches today, set at roughly four-fifths. Raising
one when the surface grows is ordinary. Lowering one is a deliberate edit that
shows up in a diff, and the only honest reason is a surface that genuinely got
smaller.
