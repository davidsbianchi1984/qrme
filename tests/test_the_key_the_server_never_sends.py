"""A member that isn't there, one layer out: a key that isn't on the wire.

0.58.2 closed by naming where the seam goes next. The receivers whose type is
known for free are now checked; the tier past them is the receiver whose
members are *keyed* rather than named — `optString("worn")`,
`GetProperty("mode")`, a `Decodable` property whose name **is** the wire key.
A renamed backend field is the same silent break as a renamed method, except
it does not fail on a build machine. It fails on a phone, quietly, as an empty
list or a nil string, and the screen renders as though the server had nothing
to say.

## What can be judged, and what cannot

Matching a key to the *route* it came from needs a type checker this machine
does not have. Matching it to the backend's whole vocabulary does not. So this
guard asks only the question it can answer honestly:

    is this key one the server can emit anywhere at all?

A key that appears nowhere in the backend is wrong with no judgement call
attached. A key that appears on some other route passes — this check is a
floor, not a ceiling, and it will not catch a field read off the wrong
response. Narrow and true.

## What the first run found

Four live breaks in this product, each of them a screen that renders empty:

* `GET /places/{surface}/{id}/overlay` answers with `overlays`. The iPhone and
  the Android read `worn`. That is the disclosure naming who in a place is
  wearing a face over their camera — the reason the feature is allowed at all
  — and on both phones it was always the empty list.
* `POST /auth/oauth/{provider}/start` answers with `url`. Both phones read
  `authorize_url`, got nil, and had nothing to open. Sign in with Google and
  Apple could not start on either.
* `/dock/where/{face}` answers with `screen`, `path` and `title`. The Android
  helper printed `screen · tab`, so half of every "where does this live"
  answer was blank.
* `/interactors/{id}/referrals` answers with `provider_id` and `opened_at`.
  All three shells read `specialist_profile_id` and a boolean `opened`.

Windows had the overlay, the sign-in and the fine-tuning run right, and the
referral wrong; the iPhone had them all wrong. There is no shell that is
reliably the correct one, which is the argument for checking all three.

## The rest of what it found

Nine `Decodable` structs whose result is discarded — `let _: Out = try await
request(…)` — named keys the routes do not send. Nothing read them, so nothing
broke; they were documentation of a wire shape that was never true. They are
empty structs now, which is what "this call's body is not read" actually looks
like.

## The traps it walked into first

Three, all in the reader rather than the code:

1. A regex that ends a struct at the first `\\n}` swallows everything after a
   nested one. `CustodyProvenance` has three.
2. `var stands: Bool { valid ?? verified ?? false }` is a computed property,
   and `let _: Ok = try await …` is a discarded binding. Neither is a key.
3. `case profileId = "profile_id"` renames it. Reporting `profileId` would be
   reporting the shell's own spelling as the server's.

And one in the vocabulary: the backend puts keys on the wire by four routes —
a dict literal, `out["key"] = …` after the fact, a Pydantic field, and
`dict(row)` over a SELECT, which makes every *column* a key. Reading only the
first of those reported some sixty fields that are on the wire every day.
