"""The key was right and the shape was wrong.

0.58.3 checked that every key a shell decodes is one the backend can send. It
found four live breaks and left a named gap: the check is a *union*, so a key
read off the wrong response passes. The obvious next step was to bind each
decode site to the route it calls and compare per route.

## Four attempts at that, and why none of them shipped

The binding is not derivable by reading this backend, and each narrowing that
removed a false positive removed real coverage with it:

1. **Route -> handler -> return.** Handlers delegate (`return desks.leave(...)`),
   wrap (`return {"beacons": [...]}`), and merge (`{**metrics}`). Following one
   level resolved 141 of some 400 routes, and the resulting mismatch list was
   41 rows of which the ones checked by hand were the reader's fault.
2. **Flat-only, both sides.** Restricting to handlers returning one flat dict
   and models with only scalar properties cut coverage to 52 sites and still
   left a 42% mismatch rate.
3. **Bind on the container key instead of the route** — `chapters: [{...}]`.
   The first run reported five defects that are not there, because `llm.py`
   builds `{"messages": [...]}` as an outbound *request*. Restricting to
   route-reachable returns fixed that and broke the real finding instead.
4. **Disjointness rather than subset**, to survive a key with two shapes. It
   survives them by not judging them: `members` is built two ways, one of
   them behind a variable, so the union it compares against is incomplete.

The rule narrow enough to be sound — container key appearing exactly once in
the package, element model named exactly once in the shell — covers two sites
per product and finds nothing. That is the honest ceiling of inference here.

## So this file infers nothing

It pins. Each row names a shell model, and the backend function whose `return`
is that model's contract. No resolution, no guessing which route a call site
hits: a human read both ends once, and the file holds them together from then
on. It is small on purpose, and it is meant to grow one verified row at a time.

## What the pinning found

The guided tour, broken on both phones and correct on Windows:

* `/tutorial` sends `chapters: [{chapter, steps}]`. The iPhone read `key` and
  `title` off the chapter, so every row of the outline rendered as `?`; the
  Android read the same two and got a list of empty pairs. It also looped over
  a `lessons` key that the route has never sent.
* `/tutorial/start`, `/tutorial/progress/{id}` and `/tutorial/done` all answer
  with `tutorial.where`, which **wraps** the step: `{learner_id, guide, step,
  done, total, finished, note}`. Both phones decoded the wrapper as a bare
  step and read `title`, `key` and `next` off the top level. All three buttons
  showed an empty line.
* `/tutorial/steps/{key}` sends the lesson text as `what`. The iPhone read
  `body`, got nil, and fell back to repeating the title.

Windows had all four right — and carried a comment saying a chapter never had
a `key` or a `title` of its own. Somebody fixed one shell and the note never
crossed to the others, which is the argument for a file rather than a comment.

## The second batch, and the louder one

0.58.4 closed by naming where the table should grow: the surfaces where an
empty render reads as *nothing to report* rather than as a bug. The first of
those was worse than the tutorial.

`GET /rooms/{id}/mic` and `GET /places/{surface}/{id}/microphone` answer with
**`microphones_lent`**. All three shells read `lent`. So the disclosure naming
who in a room has lent the profiles an open microphone — device, gain, and
since when — rendered as nobody, on the iPhone, on the Android, and on
Windows. The route's own docstring spends a paragraph on why that disclosure
is readable by everyone present rather than by its subject alone, because a
disclosure only its subject can see is not a disclosure. One that nobody can
see is less than that.

The inbox and the overlay disclosure were checked in the same pass and are
correct; they are pinned anyway. A row that passes on the day it is written is
the point of the table, not a wasted one.

## What the reader learned to follow

Three shapes, all of them assignment inside the one pinned function:
`out = {...}` with `out["k"] = …` after it, `rows = [{...} for r in …]`, and
`rows = []` with `rows.append(row)`. 0.58.4 named the last of those as a limit
and refused to guess past it; JIM's Kotlin table sat empty because of it. It
is read now rather than guessed, and JIM's table is not empty any more. A
`**spec` is resolved the same way — to a module-level dict of dicts whose
values all carry the same keys, directly or through the `for _k, spec in
SOMETHING.items()` that produced it — and refused outright when it is anything
else.

## The third batch: the refusal surfaces

0.58.5 closed by naming these — the screens that render what the platform will
**not** do, from data rather than prose, so the screen cannot drift from the
behaviour. An empty render of one of those does not read as a bug. It reads as
*no limits*, which is the worst failure mode a consent screen has.

Five of them, on all three shells: the overlay catalogue's kinds and refusals,
the microphone vocabulary's refusals, the places a wearable may be lent, and
the cloud-contribution log. **All correct.** Nine new rows hold them there.

Two rounds running the finding was on every shell at once, not one — the shells
agree with each other and disagree with the server. Cross-checking the clients
against each other would have found neither. This table is the only instrument
in the repository that catches that, which is the argument for growing it even
on a round where it finds nothing.

## What the reader learned this time

Three more lookups, all still inside the one pinned function or the module it
lives in — no cross-module inference:

* `{**dict(r), …}` over `conn.execute("SELECT id, condition, … FROM …")`. The
  column list is a string literal right there, so the keys `dict(r)` carries
  are readable. `SELECT *` is not, and is refused.
* A `**spec` bound by a *comprehension* generator, not only by a `for`
  statement.
* `list(_PROGRAMS.values())` and a module table written as a dict
  comprehension, which is how PDI's compliance catalogue is built.

## Auditing the reader, and what that turned up

0.58.6 injected a defect into PDI's `ComplianceProgram` and this file did not
fail. PDI writes `struct X: Decodable { let a: T; let b: T }` on one line and
the property pattern required end-of-line, so the reader saw that struct as
**empty** — and an empty set is a subset of anything, so the pin had passed
against nothing for a release.

Every pin now asserts on both ends: the model read something, and what it read
shares at least one key with the contract. Deliberately not a size floor —
`MicPlacesOut` and `ChainState` are honest one-property wrappers. Three more
checks read the readers themselves against a second opinion: every struct whose
conformance list mentions `Decodable` must be one `_STRUCT` can see, every C#
record must survive paren-matching, and every property the language declares
must be one the property pattern finds. A reader that goes blind is
indistinguishable from a guard that is holding.

### What the second opinion found on its first run

Not a reader bug. A missing brace.

`struct SpecialistRow: Decodable {` was never closed, and the
`extension ApiClient {` that should have followed it was never opened.
**Ninety-five client methods** — the whole *face it shows the world* block,
avatar through experience — were declared as members of a two-field wire model
rather than on the client. Every screen calling `ApiClient.shared.avatar(…)`
had nothing to call.

Three guards were in a position to see it and none did. Brace *balance*
(0.57.5) passed: the file balances perfectly, one brace simply belongs to the
wrong opener. The member check (0.58.1) passed: the methods are in
`ApiClient.swift`, just nested inside a struct. This file's own pins passed:
`SpecialistRow` is not pinned. What gave it away was a check written to audit
the reader rather than the code — and what it caught was the thing nobody had
thought to assert, because it is too obviously true to say out loud:

    a wire model is data, and data has no methods

That assertion is here now, and it costs one line to run.
