"""The key was right and the shape was wrong.

0.58.3 checked that every key a shell decodes is one the backend can send. It
found four live breaks and left a named gap: the check is a *union*, so a key
read off the wrong response passes. The obvious next step was to bind each
decode site to the route it calls and compare per route.

## Four attempts at that, and why none of them shipped

The binding is not derivable by reading this backend, and each narrowing that
removed a false positive removed real coverage with it:

1. **Route -> handler -> return.** Handlers delegate (`return desks.leave(...)`),
   wrap (`return {"beacons": [...]}`), and merge (`{**metrics}`). Following one
   level resolved 141 of some 400 routes, and the resulting mismatch list was
   41 rows of which the ones checked by hand were the reader's fault.
2. **Flat-only, both sides.** Restricting to handlers returning one flat dict
   and models with only scalar properties cut coverage to 52 sites and still
   left a 42% mismatch rate.
3. **Bind on the container key instead of the route** — `chapters: [{...}]`.
   The first run reported five defects that are not there, because `llm.py`
   builds `{"messages": [...]}` as an outbound *request*. Restricting to
   route-reachable returns fixed that and broke the real finding instead.
4. **Disjointness rather than subset**, to survive a key with two shapes. It
   survives them by not judging them: `members` is built two ways, one of
   them behind a variable, so the union it compares against is incomplete.

The rule narrow enough to be sound — container key appearing exactly once in
the package, element model named exactly once in the shell — covers two sites
per product and finds nothing. That is the honest ceiling of inference here.

## So this file infers nothing

It pins. Each row names a shell model, and the backend function whose `return`
is that model's contract. No resolution, no guessing which route a call site
hits: a human read both ends once, and the file holds them together from then
on. It is small on purpose, and it is meant to grow one verified row at a time.

## What the pinning found

The guided tour, broken on both phones and correct on Windows:

* `/tutorial` sends `chapters: [{chapter, steps}]`. The iPhone read `key` and
  `title` off the chapter, so every row of the outline rendered as `?`; the
  Android read the same two and got a list of empty pairs. It also looped over
  a `lessons` key that the route has never sent.
* `/tutorial/start`, `/tutorial/progress/{id}` and `/tutorial/done` all answer
  with `tutorial.where`, which **wraps** the step: `{learner_id, guide, step,
  done, total, finished, note}`. Both phones decoded the wrapper as a bare
  step and read `title`, `key` and `next` off the top level. All three buttons
  showed an empty line.
* `/tutorial/steps/{key}` sends the lesson text as `what`. The iPhone read
  `body`, got nil, and fell back to repeating the title.

Windows had all four right — and carried a comment saying a chapter never had
a `key` or a `title` of its own. Somebody fixed one shell and the note never
crossed to the others, which is the argument for a file rather than a comment.

## The second batch, and the louder one

0.58.4 closed by naming where the table should grow: the surfaces where an
empty render reads as *nothing to report* rather than as a bug. The first of
those was worse than the tutorial.

`GET /rooms/{id}/mic` and `GET /places/{surface}/{id}/microphone` answer with
**`microphones_lent`**. All three shells read `lent`. So the disclosure naming
who in a room has lent the profiles an open microphone — device, gain, and
since when — rendered as nobody, on the iPhone, on the Android, and on
Windows. The route's own docstring spends a paragraph on why that disclosure
is readable by everyone present rather than by its subject alone, because a
disclosure only its subject can see is not a disclosure. One that nobody can
see is less than that.

The inbox and the overlay disclosure were checked in the same pass and are
correct; they are pinned anyway. A row that passes on the day it is written is
the point of the table, not a wasted one.

## What the reader learned to follow

Three shapes, all of them assignment inside the one pinned function:
`out = {...}` with `out["k"] = …` after it, `rows = [{...} for r in …]`, and
`rows = []` with `rows.append(row)`. 0.58.4 named the last of those as a limit
and refused to guess past it; JIM's Kotlin table sat empty because of it. It
is read now rather than guessed, and JIM's table is not empty any more. A
`**spec` is resolved the same way — to a module-level dict of dicts whose
values all carry the same keys, directly or through the `for _k, spec in
SOMETHING.items()` that produced it — and refused outright when it is anything
else.
