"""A gallery row that is longer than its neighbours is a hole in every other row.

Reported from a phone: watch faces 05, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 and 36 were not
visible in JIM-mini's README. That is exactly the set of cells in the last
column, and the reason was two layers deep.

An HTML table is as wide as its **longest row**. JIM's watch gallery had six
rows of five and one row of six, so the table was six columns wide: every
five-cell row rendered a sixth empty column, and on a phone the whole thing
was clipped past the fourth. This repo's main gallery was worse — one `<tr>`
carrying **fifteen** cells beside rows of three, which made that table fifteen
columns wide and left twelve empty columns on almost every row.

    asked     is every screen in the gallery
    mattered  is every screen in the gallery *on the page*

`test_docs_gallery.py` next door already checks that every drawing is
referenced and every reference resolves, and it passed the whole time. A cell
can be present in the markup and pushed off the visible page by the row it
sits in, which is a thing only the shape of the table can tell you.

## What counts as a gallery here

A `<table>` whose picture cells all point at one folder under `docs/`, with at
least four of them. That deliberately excludes the caption pairs — an image
beside a paragraph — and the hand-composed montage that shows one screen on
three devices at once. Those are layouts, not lists.

Four across is the number, not three or five: four is what fits the phone the
report came from, and a wider grid is the defect being described.
