"""The conversation that survives leaving the app, and what it owes for that.

The console's walk-along strip carries a conversation across a screen change
and stops dead when the browser puts the page away. That is not a shortcoming
of the strip — a backgrounded web page has its recogniser ended by the
browser — and the strip says so on screen rather than pretending otherwise.

    asked     can the conversation survive a screen change
    mattered  can it survive leaving the application

On a phone the answer can be yes, and the price is a foreground service
holding a microphone while the person is somewhere else entirely. That
notification is not a platform tax to be minimised. It is the whole
difference between *the conversation you took with you* and *an app recording
you after you left it*, and the two are the same code with different honesty.

So this file holds the declarations, which is what an environment with no
Android toolchain can actually check — and which is also, conveniently, the
half whose absence is a microphone with no indicator:

  * the permissions are asked for, including the one for the notification;
  * the service is declared, not exported, and typed as a microphone service;
  * the foreground start is made with that type;
  * the notification is ongoing and its first action ends the conversation;
  * nothing restarts the service by itself.

## What this cannot check

Whether it works. There is no compiler here, so the loop — the recogniser,
the turn, the voice — has been reasoned about and not run. The guard says
what it is checking so nobody reads a green suite as a working feature; the
CHANGELOG says the same thing in the reader's direction.
