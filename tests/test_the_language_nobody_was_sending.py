"""The language nobody was sending.

## The finding

JIM's public surface answers people who have no account yet: the sign-up and verification steps, and the routes a person reaches before there is a user to store a language against. Those handlers compose real sentences — what was sent, what is held, what to do next.

Every one of those sentences is chosen from `Accept-Language`. **No native
shell was sending that header.** The browser sends it without being asked,
which is why the console looked correct and the three clients a person is most
likely to be holding were the ones answering in English.

    asked     can the shell say it in the reader's language
    mattered  does the reader's language ever reach the server

## What was missing, and where

Two things, and only the second one is obvious once the first is written down:

* **A language to send.** Each shell's `language` is read from the stored
  account setting and is `"en"` until an account exists. `L10n.deviceLanguage`
  (iOS), `L10n.deviceLanguage()` (Android) and `L10n.DeviceLanguage()`
  (Windows) read what the device has been carrying all along —
  `Locale.preferredLanguages`, the system configuration's locale list,
  `CurrentUICulture` — drop the region, and fall back to English rather than
  guessing.
* **Somewhere to send it.** One line in each shell's shared request helper.

Both halves are checked below, because a header set to a constant looks
identical to a header set correctly from the outside.
