"""The third axis: the three shells' tables against each other.

## Where this came from

0.48.0 compared keys *inside* one table. 0.48.1 compared the console's table
with each shell's. Both rounds ended by naming the same gap: two rows could not
be reconciled because **the three native tables disagreed with each other**, so
there was no single native wording for the console to adopt. Neither round
could fix them, because nothing had ever compared the shells.

    asked     does each table agree with itself, and with the console
    mattered  do the three shells agree with each other

This file closes that. It is the third and last of the three axes, and the
honest result is that it was nearly closed already:

| | same key, 2+ shells | disagreeing | same English, all three | with no shared wording |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| QRME | 1056 | **1** | 972 | **1** |
| JIM-mini | 261 | 0 | 204 | **3** |
| PDI | 51 | 0 | 47 | 0 |

Four rows across three products. Recording that plainly matters more than the
size of it: the previous two rounds each pointed at this axis as the next
large thing, and it is not large. A guard that had been written on the
assumption it would be would have been built to find much more than exists.

## The four

* **`action.sign_out`, Portuguese.** The phones said *Sair*; the Windows shell
  said *Terminar sessão*. *Sair* is *leave* or *exit*; ending a session in
  pt-PT is *terminar sessão*, so the odd shell out was the correct one and the
  other two moved to it.
* **JIM's `Translate`** — 翻訳 on the iPhone against 翻訳する on the other two,
  and अनुवाद against अनुवाद करें. A noun against a verb, on a button.
* **JIM's `Me`** — わたし on two shells and 自分 on the third.
* **JIM's `When something breaks`** — 出问题的时候 against 当出问题时.

## Majority, not a favourite

Where two shells agree and one does not, the odd one out is the drift, and the
fix follows the two. Where all three differ there is no majority to follow, the
row is a judgement rather than a defect, and it is recorded instead — the same
rule `native_split_wordings.txt` leads with. No row in any of the three
products needed that yet; the check exists so that the first one to arrive is
recorded rather than guessed at.

## What this file checks

1. **a key two shells share says the same thing** — the strict half, since two
   shells holding one key mean it by construction;
2. **an English string all three hold has a wording all three share** — the
   looser half, which catches the same defect written under different keys;
3. both matched exactly against `native_shell_split.txt`, in both directions;
4. **the tables still parse**, and **the overlap is still large** — 972 English
   strings are common to all three shells here, and a number far below that
   means the extraction changed rather than the product.
