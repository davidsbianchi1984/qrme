"""A value inside a script is not markup, and neither escaper knows both.

0.59.3 shipped a Content-Security-Policy with a nonce and called it the second
line of defence; 0.59.4 made the first line — escaping into HTML — a guard.
This is the third sink, and it is the one where **both of those miss**.

Inside a `<script>` element the HTML parser ends the element at the first
`</script`, whatever the JavaScript quoting says. So a value containing
`</script>` closes the script early and everything after it is parsed as
markup — in the page's own nonced script, which the policy exists to permit.
Neither `json.dumps` nor `html.escape` handles that alone:

    json.dumps    escapes what would end a JS *string*      — not the element
    html.escape   escapes what would open an HTML *tag*     — not a JS string

The composition is the whole helper, and getting it wrong is silent:
`json.dumps("</script>")` looks perfectly escaped.

    asked     is the value a valid JavaScript string
    mattered  can the value end the script element

## What the sweep found

QRME's `_js` composed both. JIM-mini's and PDI's were bare `json.dumps` — a
helper written once and copied into three repositories, where the copy that
drifted is the one whose entire job is to be safe. The same shape 0.59.0 found
in a floor and 0.59.1 in a guard, in a security primitive.

Not currently reachable: every value passing through `_js` in those two
products is a database identifier or a translated constant, and a path segment
cannot carry `</script>` because the slash breaks routing before the page is
built. A latent hole, fixed anyway — the next value somebody escapes with it
is exactly the one it was written for.

## And the consoles, which turned out clean

The same question in TypeScript is `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`, `innerHTML =`,
`document.write`, `eval` and `new Function`. All three consoles have **none of
them**, which is worth keeping rather than rediscovering, so the check below
is a floor rather than a backlog. The linkifier on the community wall was read
too: it splits on `https?://` and gates on `startsWith("http")`, so a
`javascript:` scheme cannot reach an `href`.
