"""A screen that calls the localizer, and a localizer with nothing to say.

## Where this came from

Written in JIM-mini at 0.44.x, after three native screens shipped asking
`L10n` for wording that had been added to the *console's* table and to none of
the three native ones. On a device `L10n.t("self.title")` with no row returns
the key, so the screen rendered the literal string `self.title` where a
heading belongs — in every language including English.

    asked     does the screen call the localizer
    mattered  does the localizer have anything to say

It stayed in one product for several releases while the other two carried the
same three tables and the same risk. Ported here at 0.47.5, and it found the
defect it was written for on the first run.

## What this checks

Both directions are wrong in different ways, so both are checked:

* a key a shell **asks for** and does not hold is a screen showing its own
  source code;
* a key a shell **holds** and never asks for is a translation somebody paid
  attention to that no reader will ever get.

The extraction is per shell. A union tells you *some* client is fine, which is
the whole lesson of the per-client door audit.

#: interpolates a value into it read as asked for by nobody. Nine of them, on

#: **Added in 0.47.1**, and it is the mirror image of what the ratchet guard
#: was missing in the same round. That one could not see a *string* chosen by
#: a ternary; this one could not see a *key* chosen by one:
#:
#:     L10n.t(armed ? "action.update" : "cw.arm", lang)
#:
#: The key is not the first thing after the paren, so `_ASKED` read past it
#: and this file reported seventy-five live rows as asked for by nobody.
#:
#:     asked     is the key the first argument
#:     mattered  does the shell ask for it
#:
#: The failure mode is the dangerous direction: a guard that calls a row dead
#: invites somebody to delete a row a screen is using. Two branches, both
#: captured, in Swift/C# ternary form and Kotlin if/else form.

#: **Added in 0.47.6.** Three more shapes, after the ported guard reported 540
#: rows in the sibling product as asked for by nobody and reading them showed
#: most of that number was this file not looking in the right places.
#:
#: A key assembled from a prefix and a value — `L10n.t("obj.actor.\(a)")`,
#: `"obj.actor.${a}"`, `$"obj.actor.{a}"` — asks for *every* row under that
#: prefix. All six `obj.actor.*` rows are reachable; none of them appeared as
#: a literal argument anywhere.
#: Anywhere in the sources, not only at a localizer call. The first version
#: of this required `L10n.t(` in front, and missed the shape iOS uses for the
#: welcome screen's profile-kind picker — a helper that *returns* the key and
#: a caller that looks it up:
#:
#:     kind == "other_person" ? "nw.kind.other" : "nw.kind.\(kind)"
#:
#: A string literal ending in a dot with a value spliced onto it is a key
#: being assembled, wherever it sits. Requiring the call in front is the same
#: narrowness this whole comment block is a history of.
