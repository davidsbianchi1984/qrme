"""A floor nobody raised is a floor nobody is standing on.

0.58.8 found the route reader had one floor and four clients. 0.58.9 found the
localizer's floor was ten against nine hundred and forty-five. Both were the
same defect in different instruments: a number written when the surface was
small, correct on the day, never raised.

Fixing them one file at a time does not generalise. This is the sweep, and
`ratchets.py` is the convention it needed first.

## The two questions

A floor answers one question every run — *is the number satisfied* — and that
is the question that keeps passing while the floor stops meaning anything. The
second question has to be asked separately:

    asked     is the number satisfied
    mattered  is the number still near what it measures

Both live here. A floor above what its reader reaches fails every run and gets
lowered until it means nothing. A floor far below it is decoration. The
standard is the one 0.58.8 set for its own table and 0.58.9 kept: **half.** A
floor under half of what it measures is not holding anything.

## What that standard found when it was applied to everything

Every floor in this product that could be reached by a measurement failed it:

    l10n asked, per shell        10 against 945-961     ratio 0.01
    l10n held, per shell         20 against 1087-1115   ratio 0.02
    path literals, all surfaces  40 against 1407        ratio 0.03
    console call sites          200 against 429         ratio 0.47

The last one is worth reading twice, because 0.58.8 wrote that *the console is
protected* and built a round on top of that sentence. It was protected against
being blinded outright — 351 down to 74 does trip a floor of 200. It was never
protected against being halved, and half of a route reader is half an audit.
The sentence was true about the failure it was tested against and false about
the one nobody tested.

## Why the unregistered ones are counted rather than fixed

The AST sweep below finds every bare numeric floor left in this suite: an
`assert` comparing something to an integer literal with `>` or `>=`. There are
dozens. Most are fine, some are decoration, and telling them apart requires
knowing what each one measures — which is the work of registering it.

So they are held in a ratcheted backlog instead of guessed at. The count may
shrink and may not grow. A new bare floor is a new number nothing will ever
audit, and the file says so at the moment it is written rather than three
releases later.
