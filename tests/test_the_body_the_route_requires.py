"""Every guard in this family reads the answer. None of them read the question.

0.56.4 through 0.57.1 asked four clients the same thing — C# records, Swift
structs, Kotlin `org.json` reads, TypeScript type arguments — and the question
was always *does this client understand what comes back*. Thirty-three defects
across the four.

Not one of them looks at what the client **sends**. The console guard next door
makes that explicit: it skips any call carrying `method:`, which in this client
is 194 of them. Those calls were never checked by anything, in either
direction, and a request body is the same defect in mirror image:

    api.createOffering(shopId, { name, tag, blurb }, token)

If the route's model calls that field `title`, FastAPI does not shrug. It
either answers 422 — the button does nothing, forever — or, where the model
tolerates extras, silently drops the value and stores a row with the field
empty. Both are invisible from the client, which sent something and got a
response.

    asked     does the client understand the answer
    mattered  does the route understand the question

## What it is checked against

`app.openapi()`, not a regex over the Pydantic classes. The schema FastAPI
publishes *is* what FastAPI validates against, including which fields are
required and which have defaults — so this guard cannot drift from the
behaviour it is describing. Reading the models by hand would have been a
fifth extractor to get wrong.

## Three questions, and why the third one exists

* a required field the client never sends — a call that 422s every time;
* a field the client sends that the model has no property for — a value the
  user typed and the server discarded;
* a write with no body at all, to a route whose model requires one — the same
  422, arrived at from the other side. It is listed separately because the
  first check cannot see it: a call with no `body` has no keys to compare, so
  a guard that only walks bodies finds nothing wrong with sending none.
