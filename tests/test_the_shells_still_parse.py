"""Nothing here builds the phones, so nothing here notices when they stop.

0.57.4 shipped a fix and a defect in the same release. Renaming iOS's `venue`
to `locality` collided with a `locality` already declared in the same
`TradeSection`:

    @State private var locality = ""      // the place card's
    ...
    @State private var locality = ""      // the listing card's

Two stored properties of one name in one type does not compile. It reached
`main` and sat there for a release, and the reason is worth writing down
rather than apologising for: **every guard in this repo reads these files as
text.** The request-body guard extracts call shapes, the response guards
extract declarations — none of them parse, so none of them can see a syntax
error. `tsc --noEmit` covers the console. There is no Swift, Kotlin or C#
toolchain on this machine, so there is nothing to run.

    asked     do the shells say the right things to the server
    mattered  do the shells still compile

This file does not typecheck anything, and says so plainly. It checks the one
class of breakage that is invisible to a text-reading guard, cheap to detect
without a compiler, and *certain* to stop a build: a name declared twice in
one scope, and braces that do not balance.

That is a narrow claim. A green run here does not mean the shells build; it
means they do not contain the specific mistake that got past everything else.
Narrow and true beats broad and hopeful — the whole arc since 0.56.4 has been
guards that measured slightly the wrong thing and passed.
