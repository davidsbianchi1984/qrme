"""Nothing here builds the phones, so nothing here notices when they stop.

0.57.4 shipped a fix and a defect in the same release. Renaming iOS's `venue`
to `locality` collided with a `locality` already declared in the same
`TradeSection`:

    @State private var locality = ""      // the place card's
    ...
    @State private var locality = ""      // the listing card's

Two stored properties of one name in one type does not compile. It reached
`main` and sat there for a release, and the reason is worth writing down
rather than apologising for: **every guard in this repo reads these files as
text.** The request-body guard extracts call shapes, the response guards
extract declarations — none of them parse, so none of them can see a syntax
error. `tsc --noEmit` covers the console. There is no Swift, Kotlin or C#
toolchain on this machine, so there is nothing to run.

    asked     do the shells say the right things to the server
    mattered  do the shells still compile

This file does not typecheck anything, and says so plainly. It checks the one
class of breakage that is invisible to a text-reading guard, cheap to detect
without a compiler, and *certain* to stop a build: a name declared twice in
one scope, and braces that do not balance.

That is a narrow claim. A green run here does not mean the shells build; it
means they do not contain the specific mistake that got past everything else.
Narrow and true beats broad and hopeful — the whole arc since 0.56.4 has been
guards that measured slightly the wrong thing and passed.

## 0.57.6 — and the file it never opened

The paragraph above is exactly right about what it checks and exactly wrong
about what "the shells" are. It globs `*.swift`, `*.kt` and `*.cs`, calls that
three shells, and reports them parseable. The Windows shell's **screens are
not C#.** They are XAML — 3,700 lines of it here, more than every `.cs` file
in `Views/` put together — and the code-behind is the smaller half of each
page. This file read the half that happened to look like the other two shells
and pronounced on the whole thing.

Five pages across two products do not parse. Two of the five are here. Each one is a
single element carrying `x:Name` **twice**:

    <TextBlock x:Name="ConsentText" TextWrapping="Wrap" FontSize="12"
               Foreground="{StaticResource QrmeT2Brush}"
               x:Name="NothingNote" />

Duplicate attributes are forbidden by XML itself, so this is not a subtle
XAML rule — no conformant reader gets past the tag, and the build stops at
`MC3050`. It is the 0.57.4 defect in markup, arrived at the same way: a
second name was needed, and it was added to the element that was there
instead of to an element of its own.

    asked     do the files that look like code still parse
    mattered  do the shells' screens still parse

Four checks, all of them things a XAML compiler refuses outright rather than
things a reviewer would prefer: the file is well-formed XML; no two elements
in one page share a name; every handler a page names exists in its
code-behind; every control the code-behind drives is named in the page. The
last is `CS0103` — the code-behind's fields *are* the `x:Name`s, so a name
that is not in the markup is not a field, and setting `.Text` on it does not
compile.
