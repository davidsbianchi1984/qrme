"""The releases whose body says nothing about the release it belongs to.

412 of 530 published releases across the three products carried the same
v0.24.0 prose, because `RELEASE_NOTES.md` was published verbatim over every
curated body since v0.24.0. The file and the workflow that did it are deleted;
`stale_release_bodies.txt` is what remains to be repaired, one row per release.

    asked     which workflow owns the release body
    mattered  does the body say what shipped

**This file cannot check the bodies.** They live on GitHub and this suite is
hermetic — a guard that needs the network is either a skip, which is a check
that does not run, or a hard failure offline, which breaks the rule that the
local suite must be green before a push. So the comparison against GitHub is
`.github/workflows/release-bodies-sweep.yml`, and what is left here is the
record's own integrity: it parses, it counts what it says it counts, and it
only ever shrinks.
