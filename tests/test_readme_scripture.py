"""Every README ends on the rock.

The Matthew 7:24–25 passage closes the root README, and the standing rule
is that it closes *every* README in the repo — the very end, byte-identical
to the root's copy. A rule that lives in someone's memory lasts until the
next README is added; this one lives here instead.
