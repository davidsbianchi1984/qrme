"""English on a screen that the same shell already translates.

The shape 0.47.9 found in the iPhone's voiceprint consent block, and 0.54.0
found again in the Windows beacon list:

    Detail = $"{b.Location ?? "—"} · {b.Scans} scan(s)"
             + (b.Active ? "" : " · picked up"),

while `nmg.beacon.scans` — *"{n} scan(s)"* — and `nmg.beacon.pickedup` —
*"picked up"* — sat in that same shell's table, translated into ten languages,
asked for by nothing. An owner reading the app in German was shown

    Garten · 3 scan(s) · picked up

which is the worst version of a localized product: translated chrome around
the two words that carry the meaning, so the screen looks finished and reads
as broken.

## Why the dead-key guard did not catch it

`test_a_shell_asks_for_a_key_it_has` sees a row nothing asks for and records
it. That is the right measurement and it is one step short: it cannot tell a
row **waiting for a screen that does not exist** from a row whose screen
exists and is printing the English by hand. Both look like silence from the
table's side. The 335-row backlog held both kinds, and only reading the
screens told them apart.

So this asks the other question: is any string a shell **shows** identical to
the English of a row that shell **holds**?

## What it deliberately does not flag

A literal in a display position is a bug. A literal anywhere else is usually a
protocol value — a JSON field name, a default a form posts back, a `kind` the
API matches on — and translating one of those breaks the request rather than
the reader. `DockStateBox.Text = "handle"` reads like a label and is a value
this page sends; it stays English on purpose.

That is why this greps **assignment into a display property**, not the whole
source. The first version of this check greped everything, reported 88 hits
across three shells, and 86 of them were protocol values. A guard that cries
wolf 86 times out of 88 is one nobody reads.

## 0.57.8 — the rows this skipped, and why they were the interesting ones

For four releases `_rows` opened with

    if "{" in english:
        continue

and every row with a slot in it went unchecked. That is not a small corner of
the table: a row with a slot is a row about *something*, which is most of what
a screen actually says. And a sentence assembled around a value is the one a
screen is most likely to hand-build, because building it is what the code is
already doing:

    ? $"closest overlap {best}, below the {th} threshold for naming anyone"

against `ns.who.below` — *"closest overlap {best}, below the {threshold}
threshold for naming anyone"* — the same sentence, hole for hole, sitting in
that same shell's table in ten languages.

    asked     does a screen print a whole English row verbatim
    mattered  does a screen print an English row the reader will never see
              translated, however it is spelled

Found from the other side, and by accident: 0.57.7 was fixing a Windows page
that would not parse, read the code-behind while deciding a rename, and saw
seven of these on one screen. This closes the general case rather than the
seven.

### How a slotted row is compared

Not by rebuilding the sentence — the shell's holes are not the table's, and
`{en.Seconds:F1}s` is not `{secs}`. The row is split at its slots and the
**literal fragments between them** are compared: a fragment of a row that
appears verbatim inside a string a screen shows is that row being printed in
English.

Fragments shorter than a phrase are dropped. `Built {date}` contributes only
*"Built"*, which is a word that turns up in prose that has nothing to do with
it, and a guard that reports that is one nobody reads — the same lesson as
the eighty-six protocol values. So this misses short rows, deliberately, and
says so.

#:     status, so it must be the word the server would have sent.
#:
#: Every remaining row is here because it was read, not because it was

#:     $"Raised. The profile is {r.ProfileStatus ?? "restricted"} pending review."
#:
#: and the literal extractor cannot see a string nested inside an interpolation
#: — it matches from the opening quote to the quote before `restricted`, so the
#: word was hidden by the very defect this round was fixing. Filling the row
#: put the fallback on its own line and the guard saw it immediately. It is
#: recorded for the reason iOS's copy already carries: the status word the
#: server sends is displayed as sent, so the fallback has to be the word the
#: server would have sent.
