/**
 * What went wrong, and exactly what leaves this device.
 *
 * The preview is not a description of the report — it *is* the report, from the
 * same function that produces the copied text and the posted body. A screen
 * that summarised the payload in prose would be making a promise the code could
 * quietly break; this one can only be wrong in the way the payload is wrong.
 *
 * Two lists on purpose. The rows are the whole history, which is the user's;
 * the preview is the unreported remainder, which is the message. After a send
 * the history is unchanged and the preview is empty, and that difference is the
 * honest picture rather than a bug in the screen.
