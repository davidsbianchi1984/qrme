 * The version handshake, made visible.
 *
 * A stale backend from an older install answers /health perfectly well and
 * then serves an older API — so the app looks alive while every newer
 * screen (medications, care team, coach context) answers "Not Found" with
 * no explanation. The Electron shell already refuses to adopt a
 * version-mismatched backend on its own port, but a *stored* base URL (for
 * example the machine's LAN address saved for the phone bridge) can still
 * route the console to whatever old process holds that address.
 *
 * This banner closes the loop from the console side: compare the console's
 * build version against what /health reports, and on mismatch say so in a
 * sentence, with the one-click fix when there is one.
