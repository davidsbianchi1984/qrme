/**
 * The help box, on every screen.
 *
 * Mounted from the edge dock rather than by any screen, because "available
 * on all screens" is a property of the shell rather than something each
 * screen can be trusted to remember — and the one screen that forgets is
 * the one somebody is stuck on.
 *
 * Deliberately faceless and unnamed. This product's whole subject is
 * synthetic people who can be mistaken for real ones, so a help assistant
 * with a portrait and a name would be one more character to tell apart
 * rather than the thing that explains the others.
 *
 * It was a "?" bubble fixed to the bottom-right corner. It is a tab on the
 * dock now: the same panel, opened beside the tab instead of over the
 * corner of whatever screen was underneath.
