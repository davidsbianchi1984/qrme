# QRME v0.11.1 — release notes

*Ready-to-paste body for the GitHub Release created when you push the
`app-v0.11.1` tag. Kept in sync with [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md).*

---

**QRME v0.11.1** — **no functional change in this release**: cut
with the siblings. In PDI, the desktop app finally carries its own vault:
a bundled backend (no more "Failed to fetch" on first run), a master key
generated once and persisted, and a release gate that creates a tenant,
seals, restarts and reads back on every OS before packaging.

### Verification

1194 tests green, unchanged in behaviour.

### Install

If you have 0.7.0 or later, this arrives on its own — one restart when
prompted.
