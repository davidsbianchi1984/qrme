"""Operating QRME from a phone.

The studio in ``app/`` is a web app, so a phone on the same network can run
it directly from this backend — no app store, no separate dev server. Two
pieces make that work:

* :func:`console_dir` — the built studio (``app/dist``), mounted by the API
  at ``/app`` when it has been built. Serving it from the API means the phone
  loads the UI and calls the API on **one origin**, so there is no CORS setup
  and no "which host is the backend?" question: the studio defaults to the
  origin it was served from.
* :func:`pairing` — what to type (or scan) on the phone. It resolves the
  machine's LAN address so the answer is a URL the phone can actually reach,
  rather than ``127.0.0.1``, which on a phone means the phone itself.

Nothing here changes the security posture: the API still requires the owner
or interactor bearer token for anything personal, and a phone on the LAN is
exactly as authorized as a laptop on the LAN.
